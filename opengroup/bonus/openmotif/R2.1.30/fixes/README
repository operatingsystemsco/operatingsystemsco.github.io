Open Motif Patches
Last Update
16 July 2000



Acknowledgements

Many thanks to the folks at the MotifZone (ICS)
(http://www.motifzone.net) for validating and supplying patch1 and patch2 
and for Takaaki Nomura and Kevin Holbrook for finding and reporting the first
bugs in the distribution.

Many thanks for Metro Link Inc., especially Jim Burmeister, for
contributing a substantial number of fixes and enhancements supplied in
patch3, patch4 and patch5.

Patch Contents

Patch 1 contains a fix to mwm for a divide by zero problem
in the icon box.

Patch 2 contains other various changes to support the build on additional
platforms.

Patch 3 contains the Metro Link changes to the Motif libraries, clients, and 
related files; basically everything except the demo source code.

Patch 4 contains the Metro Link changes to the demo source code.

Patch 5 contains Metro Link updates to all of the stuff under the
"config" directory, including the Imake configuration files, imake, and
makedepend.  The patch brings the configuration up to date with recent
versions of XFree86, allowing Open Motif to build cleanly on most
current platforms.  This patch is optional, since you don't need to
update the stuff under "config" if you use ICS's build method of
linking in the configuration files installed on your system.  Some folks
prefer having them part of the Motif build tree, so the patch was created
in case others prefer it too.

See the individual  README files for detailed descriptions of patches 3 to 5.


POSIX cksums:

To apply the patches:

cd to the top of the source tree (to the directory containing the "motif"
subdirectory) and do:

        patch -p -s < patchfile

Patch will work silently unless an error occurs.
If you want to watch patch do its thing, leave out the "-s" argument
to patch.

Finally, to rebuild after applying a patch, cd to the "motif" subdirectory
and follow the instructions in the RELNOTES
