		 Installation and Release Notes



System Requirements

    The Linux package was built on Red Hat Linux 6.1 and is thus
	  suitable for that or a compatible Linux system

    The FreeBSD package was built on FreeBSD 3.4.

    Developers on FreeBSD will need the glibc wide character
    support routines that are not otherwise available on
    FreeBSD.  These are available as
    http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~crossd/FreeBSD/wcs-19990606.tar.gz
    They are not required if you are only interested in the
    runtime parts of the distribution.


Package Content

There is one package for each platform, containing what is
often referred to as runtime and development software.

Each package contains the Motif static and shared libraries,
Motif window manager (mwm), UIL Compiler (uil), Motif support
files, executable demo programs, and the header files needed
to compile Motif programs from source code.


Installation Instructions

To install the packages, use the following commands:

    On Linux:    rpm -ivh openmotif-2.1.30-1_IST.i386.rpm

    On FreeBSD:  pkg_add openmotif-2.1.30-1_IST.tgz
