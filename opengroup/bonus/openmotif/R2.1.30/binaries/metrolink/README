                         Open Motif 2.1.30
               Metro Link Incorporated Binary Packages
                      Release 4 (July 5, 2000)
                      
                   Installation and Release Notes


=== Changes Since Previous Releases ===

Metro Link Open Motif release 4 includes official Open Motif patches
#1 and #2.  It also includes approximately 30 significant bug fixes
and enhancements to the Motif libraries and window manager, plus many
minor source changes and over 100 fixes to the Motif demo source
code.  These changes were developed for Metro Link's commercial Motif
products, and are now being contributed back to Open Motif.

The Linux binaries are now built with multi-byte language support
enabled.  Some multi-byte testing has been done, but if you encounter
any problems with multi-byte support, please report them so that we
can work on fixing them.

The development packages now install updated versions of the imake
configuration files Motif.rules and Motif.tmpl into
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config/.  Some versions of Linux and FreeBSD are
missing these files, or have outdated versions.


=== System Requirements ===

Linux packages are provided for x86, Alpha, and PowerPC architectures.
The packages should work on any Linux distribution with at least Linux
kernel 2.2, glibc 2.1.1, XFree86 3.3.3, and the rpm package installer.
This includes the following x86 distributions:

    o Red Hat Linux 6.0 or later
    o Mandrake Linux 6.0 or later
    o S.u.S.E. Linux 6.2 or later
    o Caldera OpenLinux 2.4 or later
    o TurboLinux 6.0 or later

The following Alpha Linux distributions meet the requirements:

    o Red Hat Linux 6.0 or later
    o S.u.S.E. Linux 6.1 or later

The following PowerPC Linux distributions meet the requirements:

    o Yellow Dog Linux Champion Server 1.2 or later
    o Linux/PPC 1999 or later

FreeBSD packages require FreeBSD 3.0 or later.


=== Installation Instructions ===

There are two packages for each platform: runtime and development.
The runtime package contains the Motif shared libraries, Motif window
manager (mwm), and Motif support files.  The development package
includes the header files and static libraries needed to compile
Motif programs from source code.

To install the packages, use the following commands:

    Linux:   rpm -ivh openmotif-2.1.30-4_MLI.i386.rpm
             rpm -ivh openmotif-devel-2.1.30-4_MLI.i386.rpm
    (for Alpha and PowerPC, the file names are slightly different)

    FreeBSD: pkg_add openmotif-2.1.30-4_MLI.tgz
             pkg_add openmotif-devel-2.1.30-4_MLI.tgz

    
=== Compiling Motif Programs that Use Imake ===

Many X Window System programs use the imake(1) facility to generate
Makefiles.  This facility, usually accessed through the xmkmf(1)
command, allows for greater software portability by using platform-
independent Imakefiles from which regular Makefiles are generated at
build time.  When you install the Motif development package, the
system imake configuration files located in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config
are modified so that the imake environment knows that Motif has been
installed on the system.  Motif programs that use Imakefiles can then
be built in the same way as any other X programs that use imake,
which is usually as simple as typing:

	xmkmf -a
	make

Some Imakefiles are not written to properly take advantage of the
Motif information in the imake configuration files.  If your program
compiles but fails to link, this is most likely the case.  If this
happens, examine the command line used in the link step and compare
the libraries used to the library lists in the next section.  In
particular, -lXp may be missing, as it is a new requirement as of
Motif 2.1.  Try adding the missing library to the Imakefile or
Makefile and rebuild.


=== Compiling Motif Programs Without Using Imake ===

If the program you are building does not use Imakefiles, or if you do
not wish to use this facility, you must set up compiling and linking
commands manually.  For compilation, the option -I/usr/X11R6/include
is necessary for the compiler to find the header files.

The link step needs the option -L/usr/X11R6/lib so that the X and
Motif libraries can be found.  The list of libraries and the order in
which they appear on the command line is also important.  The
following example illustrates linking a simple program with the Motif
library and all of the libraries it depends on.

	gcc -o foo foo.o -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lXm -lXp -lXt -lSM -lICE \
	     -lXext -lX11

If your Motif program also uses the Motif Resource Manager (MRM)
library, then -lMrm should be inserted into the command line before
-lXm.


=== Problems/Comments? ===

Metro Link does not provide technical support for the Open Motif
binary packages.  However, we are interested in hearing your
feedback.  Comments, suggestions, and problem reports may be
e-mailed to <openmotif@metrolink.com>.  In particular, if you would
like to see additional operating systems, architectures, or package
formats supported, drop us a line; our choices for future releases
will be based on demand.

Metro Link does provide fully supported commercial versions of Motif
for a variety of platforms.  See our web site at www.metrolink.com
for details.
