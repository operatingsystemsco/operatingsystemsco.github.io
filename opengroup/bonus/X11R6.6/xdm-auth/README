If you are looking for the file xc/lib/Xdmcp/Wraphelp.c, be advised
that export of this software from the United States of America is
assumed to require a specific license from the United States
Government.  It is the responsibility of any person or organization
contemplating export to obtain such a license before exporting.
Previously you would have find what you are looking for, in compressed
form, as the file /private/xdm/help on this machine. However since we
moved the server outside of the USA we had to remove the file.


A compatible version of this file, implemented outside the US, can be
obtained by anonymous ftp to ftp.psy.uq.oz.au (130.102.32.1) in the
directory /pub/X11R5/, a copy of which is also now in this directory.
