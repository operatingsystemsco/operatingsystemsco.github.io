                 Plug-ins built on and tested with:
plug-in                    O/S                     Netscape Product

libxrx.so.6.3-freebsd      FreeBSD 2.2.2-RELEASE   Communicator 4.03b8
libxrx.so.6.3-digunix      Digital Unix 4.0        Navigator 3.04
libxrx.sl.6.3-hpux-10.01   HPUX 10.01              Navigator 3.01
libxrx.sl.6.3-hpux-10.20   HPUX 10.20              Navigator 3.04
libxrx.so.6.3-irix         IRIX 6.2                Navigator 3.04
libxrx.so.6.3-linux2       S.u.S.E. 5.0            Navigator 3.04
libxrx.so.6.3-solaris      Solaris 2.5             Navigator 3.04
libxrx.so.6.3-solaris2.6   Solaris 2.6             Navigator 3.04
libxrx.so.aix4             AIX 4.2                 Communicator 4.04

Plugins for Digital Unix, HPUX, IRIX, Solaris, and Linux should also work 
with released and beta versions of Communicator, although I haven't tried 
it for myself. 

The HPUX-10.01 plug-in may also work on HPUX 9. 

For Solaris 2.5 and earlier use libxrx.so.6.3-solaris, otherwise use
libxrx.so.6.3-solaris2.6.

(The Linux plug-in should work on most any Linux ELF system, but Linux is 
as Linux does and if you have a custom one-of-a-kind system, or can 
otherwise be considered to be "on the bleeding edge" and and the plug-in
doesn't work, then now may be the time you're going to bleed.)

I'll presume that you know how to install a Netscape Plug-in. If not, 
consult your Netscape documentation or get the X11R6.3 release notes. Once 
installed, restart Netscape. 

If you get a popup dialog that says the program can't connect to your 
display and the name looks right, there are two things you can check. 
First, if you're organization has a firewall that is configured to block 
X protocol you need to fix that -- consult your local system administrator 
for assistance. Second, if you have a network that's connected to the 
Internet via PPP or SLIP to an ISP, your machine's name and IP address on 
your private network may not match the name and IP address that's assigned 
by DHCP when you connect. The plug-in will try to figure this out, but if 
you run Netscape on a host that's not directly connected to your ISP then 
the plug-in won't be able to determine the correct name. You may be able 
to work around this by setting the XREALDISPLAY environment variable and 
restarting Netscape.

Let me emphasize that these plug-ins are provided AS IS! If they don't work
for you, please submit a bug-report. You can get a bug-report template from 
ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/R6.3/xc/bug-report. Fill it out and email it to 
xbugs@x.org. Provide as much information as possible. If there isn't enough 
information to duplicate your problem then there's little or no chance that 
we'll be able to fix it. Don't send anything but bug-reports to xbugs@x.org. 
If you send anything else, it'll be ignored and deleted.
