<p align="center"><b>Some trademark attributions still say Novell
(or even AT&amp;T or Bell Labs), which is correct?</b> </p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" face="helvetica">UNIX</font><font
size="2" face="helvetica"><sup>®</sup></font><font size="5"> is
a registered trademark of The Open Group.</font> </p>

<p>The correct attribution is: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;UNIX is a registered trademark of The Open
    Group&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some licenses (which date from before the merger of X/Open
Company with The Open Group) still require the following
attribution:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;UNIX is a registered trademark in the United States
    and other countries, licensed exclusively through X/Open
    Company Ltd.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>All licenses will be updated in due course; in the meantime,
The Open Group is happy for either attribution to be used. Any
other attribution is incorrect. </p>

<p>The Trademark Usage Guide is available in <a href="susv2/tm/tmug2.ps">postscript</a>
or <a href="susv2/tm/tmug2.pdf">PDF</a> formats.
This guide describes the rules for
use of X/Open Company trademarks. It is designed to be a
practical guide. Of itself, this guide does not grant permission
to use any trademark. </p>

<p>Please note: </p>

<ul>
    <li>It must not be used as a generic term. </li>
    <li>It must not be used in connection with products, unless
        the product is licensed to use the mark. </li>
    <li>There are detailed guidelines referring to the visual
        presentation, form and manner of use. </li>
    <li>In editorial or articles, but not advertising the trade
        marks may be used without prior permission - <b>provided</b>
        that the rules in our Trademark Usage Guide are followed.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Motif, OSF/1, UNIX and the X device are registered trademarks and IT
DialTone, and The Open Group are trademarks of The
