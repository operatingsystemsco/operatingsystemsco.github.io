<h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1878">&nbsp;</a>NAME</h4><blockquote>
rm - remove directory entries
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1879">&nbsp;</a>SYNOPSIS</h4><blockquote>
<pre><code>

rm <b>[</b>-fiRr<b>]</b><i> file</i>...
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1880">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>rm</i>
utility removes the directory entry specified by each
<i>file</i>
argument.
<p>
If either of the files dot or dot-dot are specified as the
basename portion of an operand
(that is, the final pathname component),
<i>rm</i>
will write a diagnostic
message to standard error and do nothing more with such operands.
<p>
For each
<i>file</i>
the following steps are taken:
<ol>
<p>
<li>
If the
<i>file</i>
does not exist:
<ol type = a>
<p>
<li>
If the
<b>-f</b>
option is not specified, write a diagnostic message
to standard error.
<p>
<li>
Go on to any remaining
<i>files</i>.
<p>
</ol>
<p>
<li>
If
<i>file</i>
is of type directory, the following steps are taken:
<ol type = a>
<p>
<li>
If neither the
<b>-R</b>
option nor the
<b>-r</b>
option is specified,
write a diagnostic message to standard error, do nothing
more with
<i>file</i>,
and go on to any remaining files.
<p>
<li>
If the
<b>-f</b>
option is not specified,
and either the permissions of
<i>file</i>
do not permit
writing and the standard input is a terminal or the
<b>-i</b>
option is specified, write a prompt to
standard error
and read a line from the standard input.
If the response
is not affirmative, do nothing more with the current file
and go on to any remaining files.
<p>
<li>
For each entry contained in
<i>file</i>,
other than dot or dot-dot,
the four steps listed here (1-4) are taken
with the entry as
if it were a
<i>file</i>
operand.
<p>
<li>
If the
<b>-i</b>
option is specified, write a prompt to
standard error
and read a line from the standard input.
If the response is not affirmative, do nothing more with the
current file, and go on to any remaining files.
<p>
</ol>
<p>
<li>
If
<i>file</i>
is not of type directory, the
<b>-f</b>
option is not specified,
and either the permissions of
<i>file</i>
do not permit writing
and the standard input is a terminal or the
<b>-i</b>
option is specified,
write a prompt to the standard error and read a line from
the standard input.
If the response is not affirmative, do
nothing more with the current file and go on to any remaining files.
<p>
<li>
If the current file is a directory,
<i>rm</i>
will perform actions equivalent to the <b>XSH</b> specification
<i><a href="../xsh/rmdir.htm">rmdir()</a></i>
function called with a pathname of the current file used as the
<i>path</i>
argument.
If the current file is not a directory,
<i>rm</i>
will perform actions equivalent to the <b>XSH</b> specification
<i><a href="../xsh/unlink.htm">unlink()</a></i>
function called with a pathname of the current file used as the
<i>path</i>
argument.
<p>
If this fails for any reason,
<i>rm</i>
will write a diagnostic message to standard error,
do nothing more with the current file,
and go on to any remaining files.
<p>
</ol>
<p>
The
<i>rm</i>
utility is able to descend to arbitrary depths in a file
hierarchy, and will not fail due to path length limitations (unless an
operand specified by the user exceeds system limitations).
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1881">&nbsp;</a>OPTIONS</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>rm</i>
utility supports the <b>XBD</b> specification, <a href="../xbd/utilconv.htm#usg"><b>Utility Syntax Guidelines</b>&nbsp;</a> .
The following options are supported:
<dl compact>

<dt><b>-f</b>
<dd>Do not prompt for confirmation.
Do not write diagnostic messages
or modify the exit status in the case of non-existent operands.
Any previous occurrences of the
<b>-i</b>
option will be ignored.

<dt><b>-i</b>
<dd>Prompt for confirmation as described previously.
Any previous occurrences of the
<b>-f</b>
option will be ignored.

<dt><b>-R</b>
<dd>Remove file hierarchies.
See the DESCRIPTION section.

<dt><b>-r</b>
<dd>Equivalent to
<b>-R</b>.

</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1882">&nbsp;</a>OPERANDS</h4><blockquote>
The following operand is supported:
<dl compact>

<dt><i>file</i><dd>A pathname of a directory entry to be removed.

</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1883">&nbsp;</a>STDIN</h4><blockquote>
Used to read an input line in response to each prompt specified in
the STDOUT section.
Otherwise, the standard input will not be used.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1884">&nbsp;</a>INPUT FILES</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1885">&nbsp;</a>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h4><blockquote>
The following environment variables affect the execution of
<i>rm</i>:
<dl compact>

<dt><i>LANG</i><dd>Provide a default value for the internationalisation variables
that are unset or null.
If
<i>LANG</i>
is unset or null, the corresponding value from the
implementation-dependent default locale will be used.
If any of the internationalisation variables contains an invalid setting, the
utility will behave as if none of the variables had been defined.

<dt><i>LC_ALL</i><dd>
If set to a non-empty string value,
override the values of all the other internationalisation variables.

<dt><i>LC_COLLATE</i><dd>
Determine the locale for the
behaviour of ranges, equivalence classes,
and multi-character collating elements
used in the extended regular expression defined for the
<b>yesexpr</b>
locale keyword in the LC_MESSAGES category.

<dt><i>LC_CTYPE</i><dd>
Determine the
locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-
versus multi-byte characters in arguments) and
the behaviour of character classes within regular expressions
used in the extended regular expression defined for the
<b>yesexpr</b>
locale keyword in the LC_MESSAGES category.

<dt><i>LC_MESSAGES</i><dd>
Determine the locale for the processing of affirmative responses
that should be used to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
messages written to standard error.

<dt><i>NLSPATH</i><dd>
Determine the location of message catalogues
for the processing of
<i>LC_MESSAGES .
</i>
</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1886">&nbsp;</a>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS</h4><blockquote>
Default.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1887">&nbsp;</a>STDOUT</h4><blockquote>
Not used.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1888">&nbsp;</a>STDERR</h4><blockquote>
Prompts are written to standard error under the conditions
specified in the DESCRIPTION and OPTIONS sections.
The prompts will contain the
<i>file</i>
pathname, but their format is otherwise unspecified.
The standard error is also used for diagnostic messages.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1889">&nbsp;</a>OUTPUT FILES</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1890">&nbsp;</a>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1891">&nbsp;</a>EXIT STATUS</h4><blockquote>
The following exit values are returned:
<dl compact>

<dt>0<dd>If the
<b>-f</b>
option was not specified, all the named directory
entries were removed; otherwise, all the existing named directory
entries were removed.

<dt>&gt;0<dd>An error occurred.

</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1892">&nbsp;</a>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS</h4><blockquote>
Default.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1893">&nbsp;</a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>rm</i>
utility is forbidden to remove the names dot and dot-dot
in order to avoid the consequences of inadvertently doing something
like:
<pre>
<code>
rm -r .*
</code>
</pre>
<p>
Some systems do not permit the removal of
the last link to an executable binary file that is being executed;
see the
[EBUSY]
error in the <b>XSH</b> specification
<i><a href="../xsh/unlink.htm">unlink()</a></i>
description.
Thus, the
<i>rm</i>
utility can fail to remove such files.
<p>
The
<b>-i</b>
option causes
<i>rm</i>
to prompt and read the standard input even if the standard input is
not a terminal, but in the absence of
<b>-i</b>
the mode prompting is not done when the standard input is not a terminal.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1894">&nbsp;</a>EXAMPLES</h4><blockquote>
<ol>
<p>
<li>
The following command:
<pre>
<code>
rm a.out core
</code>
</pre>
removes the directory entries:
<b>a.out</b>
and
<b>core</b>.
<p>
<li>
The following command:
<pre>
<code>
rm -Rf junk
</code>
</pre>
removes the directory
<b>junk</b>
and all its contents, without prompting.
<p>
</ol>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1895">&nbsp;</a>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</h4><blockquote>
The IEEE PASC 1003.2 Interpretations Committee has forwarded concerns about
parts of this interface definition to the IEEE PASC Shell and Utilities Working Group
which is identifying the corrections.
A future revision of this specification will align with
IEEE Std. 1003.2b when finalised.
