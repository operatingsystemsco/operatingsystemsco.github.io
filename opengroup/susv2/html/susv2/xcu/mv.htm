<h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1479">&nbsp;</a>NAME</h4><blockquote>
mv - move files
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1480">&nbsp;</a>SYNOPSIS</h4><blockquote>
<pre><code>

mv <b>[</b>-fi<b>] </b><i>source_file target_file</i>

mv <b>[</b>-fi<b>] </b><i>source_file</i>... <i>target_file</i>
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1481">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
In the first synopsis form, the
<i>mv</i>
utility moves the file named by the
<i>source_file</i>
operand to the
<i>destination</i>
specified by the
<i>target_file</i>.
This first synopsis form is assumed when the final operand does not name
an existing directory.
<p>
In the second synopsis form,
<i>mv</i>
moves each file named by a
<i>source_file</i>
operand to a
<i>destination</i>
file in the existing directory named by the
<i>target_dir</i>
operand.
The
<i>destination</i>
path for each
<i>source_file</i>
is the
concatenation of the target directory, a single slash character,
and the last pathname component of the
<i>source_file.</i>
This second form is assumed when the final operand names an existing
directory.
<p>
If any operand specifies an existing file of a type not
specified by the <b>XSH</b> specification, the behaviour is implementation-dependent.
<p>
For each
<i>source_file</i>
the following steps are taken:
<ol>
<p>
<li>
If the destination path exists,
the
<b>-f</b>
option is not specified,
and either of the following conditions is true:
<ol type = a>
<p>
<li>
The permissions of the destination path do not permit
writing and the standard input is a terminal.
<p>
<li>
The
<b>-i</b>
option is specified.
<p>
</ol>
<p>
The
<i>mv</i>
utility will write a prompt to standard error and
read a line from standard input.
If the response is not affirmative,
<i>mv</i>
will do nothing more with the current
<i>source_file</i>
and go on to any remaining
<i>source_file</i>s.
<p>
<li>
The
<i>mv</i>
utility will perform actions equivalent to the <b>XSH</b> specification
<i><a href="../xsh/rename.htm">rename()</a></i>
function, called with the following arguments:
<ol type = a>
<p>
<li>
The
<i>source_file</i>
operand is used as the
<i>old</i>
argument.
<p>
<li>
The destination path is used as the
<i>new</i>
argument.
<p>
</ol>
<p>
If this succeeds,
<i>mv</i>
will do nothing more with the current
<i>source_file</i>
and go on to any remaining
<i>source_file</i>s.
If this fails for any reasons other than those described for the
<i>errno</i>
[EXDEV]
in the <b>XSH</b> specification,
<i>mv</i>
will write a
diagnostic message to standard error, do nothing more
with the current
<i>source_file</i>,
and go on to any remaining
<i>source_file</i>s.
<p>
<li>
If the destination path exists, and it is a file of type
directory and
<i>source_file</i>
is not a file of type directory,
or it is a file not of type directory and
<i>source_file</i>
is a file of type directory,
<i>mv</i>
will write a diagnostic message
to standard error, do nothing more with the current
<i>source_file</i>,
and go on to any remaining
<i>source_file</i>s.
<p>
<li>
If the destination path exists,
<i>mv</i>
will attempt to remove it.
If this fails for any reason,
<i>mv</i>
will write a diagnostic message to
standard error, do nothing more with the current
<i>source_file,</i>
and go on to any remaining
<i>source_file</i>s.
<p>
<li>
The file hierarchy rooted in
<i>source_file</i>
will be duplicated as
a file hierarchy rooted in the destination path.
The following
characteristics of each file in the file hierarchy will be
duplicated:
<ul>
<p>
<li>
the time of last data modification and time of last access
<p>
<li>
the user ID and group ID
<p>
<li>
the file mode.
<p>
</ul>
<p>
If the user ID, group ID or file mode of a regular file cannot
be duplicated, the file mode bits S_ISUID and S_ISGID will not
be duplicated.
<p>
When files are duplicated to another file system,
the implementation may require that the process invoking
<i>mv</i>
has read access to each file being duplicated.
<p>
If the duplication of the file hierarchy fails for any reason,
<i>mv</i>
will write a
diagnostic message to standard error, do nothing
more with the current
<i>source_file,</i>
and go on to any remaining
<i>source_file</i>s.
<p>
If the duplication of the file characteristics fails for any reason,
<i>mv</i>
will write a diagnostic message to standard error, but this
failure will not cause
<i>mv</i>
to modify its exit status.
<p>
<li>
The file hierarchy rooted in
<i>source_file</i>
will be removed.
If this fails for any reason,
<i>mv</i>
will write a diagnostic message
to the standard error, do nothing more with the current
<i>source_file,</i>
and go on to any remaining
<i>source_file</i>s.
<p>
</ol>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1482">&nbsp;</a>OPTIONS</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>mv</i>
utility supports the <b>XBD</b> specification, <a href="../xbd/utilconv.htm#usg"><b>Utility Syntax Guidelines</b>&nbsp;</a> .
<p>
The following options are supported:
<dl compact>

<dt><b>-f</b>
<dd>Do not prompt for confirmation if the destination path exists.
Any previous occurrences of the
<b>-i</b>
option will be ignored.

<dt><b>-i</b>
<dd>Prompt for confirmation if the destination path exists.
Any previous occurrences of the
<b>-f</b>
option will be ignored.

</dl>
<p>
Specifying more than one of the
<b>-f</b>
or
<b>-i</b>
options is not considered an error.
The last option specified will determine the behaviour of
<i>mv</i>.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1483">&nbsp;</a>OPERANDS</h4><blockquote>
The following operands are supported:
<dl compact>

<dt><i>source_file</i><dd>
A pathname of a file or directory to be moved.

<dt><i>target_file</i><dd>
A new pathname for the file or directory being moved.

<dt><i>target_dir</i><dd>
A pathname of an existing directory into which
to move the input files.

</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1484">&nbsp;</a>STDIN</h4><blockquote>
Used to read an input line in response to each prompt
specified in the STDERR section.
Otherwise, the standard input will not be used.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1485">&nbsp;</a>INPUT FILES</h4><blockquote>
The input files specified by each
<i>source_file</i>
operand can be of any file type.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1486">&nbsp;</a>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h4><blockquote>
The following environment variables affect the execution of
<i>mv</i>:
<dl compact>

<dt><i>LANG</i><dd>Provide a default value for the internationalisation variables
that are unset or null.
If
<i>LANG</i>
is unset or null, the corresponding value from the
implementation-dependent default locale will be used.
If any of the internationalisation variables contains an invalid setting, the
utility will behave as if none of the variables had been defined.


<dt><i>LC_ALL</i><dd>
If set to a non-empty string value,
override the values of all the other internationalisation variables.

<dt><i>LC_COLLATE</i><dd>
Determine the locale for the
behaviour of ranges, equivalence classes
and multi-character collating elements
used in the extended regular expression defined for the
<b>yesexpr</b>
locale keyword in the LC_MESSAGES category.

<dt><i>LC_CTYPE</i><dd>
Determine the
locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single- as opposed to multi-byte characters
in arguments and input files),
the behaviour of character classes
used in the extended regular expression defined for the
<b>yesexpr</b>
locale keyword in the LC_MESSAGES category.

<dt><i>LC_MESSAGES</i><dd>
Determine the locale for the processing of affirmative responses
that should be used to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
messages written to standard error.

<dt><i>NLSPATH</i><dd>
Determine the location of message catalogues
for the processing of
<i>LC_MESSAGES .
</i>
</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1487">&nbsp;</a>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS</h4><blockquote>
Default.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1488">&nbsp;</a>STDOUT</h4><blockquote>
Not used.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1489">&nbsp;</a>STDERR</h4><blockquote>
Prompts will be written to the standard error under the conditions
specified in the DESCRIPTION section.
The prompts will contain the
<i>destination</i>
pathname, but their format is otherwise unspecified.
Otherwise, the standard error will be used only for diagnostic messages.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1490">&nbsp;</a>OUTPUT FILES</h4><blockquote>
The output files may be of any file type.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1491">&nbsp;</a>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1492">&nbsp;</a>EXIT STATUS</h4><blockquote>
The following exit values are returned:
<dl compact>

<dt>0<dd>All input files were moved successfully.

<dt>&gt;0<dd>An error occurred.

</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1493">&nbsp;</a>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS</h4><blockquote>
If the copying or removal of
<i>source_file</i>
is prematurely terminated
by a signal or error,
<i>mv</i>
may leave a partial copy of
<i>source_file</i>
at the source or destination.
The
<i>mv</i>
utility will not modify both
<i>source_file</i>
and the destination path simultaneously; termination at any point
will leave either
<i>source_file</i>
or the destination path complete.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1494">&nbsp;</a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4><blockquote>
None.
<br>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1495">&nbsp;</a>EXAMPLES</h4><blockquote>
If the current directory contains only files
<b>a</b>
(of any type defined by the <b>XSH</b> specification),
<b>b</b>
(also of any type), and a directory
<b>c</b>:
<pre>
<code>
mv a b c
mv c d
</code>
</pre>
will result with the original files
<b>a</b>
and
<b>b</b>
residing in the
directory
<b>d</b>
in the current directory.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1496">&nbsp;</a>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1497">&nbsp;</a>SEE ALSO</h4><blockquote>
