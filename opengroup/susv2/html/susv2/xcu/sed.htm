<h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1973">&nbsp;</a>NAME</h4><blockquote>
sed - stream editor
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1974">&nbsp;</a>SYNOPSIS</h4><blockquote>
<pre><code>

sed <b>[</b>-n<b>] </b><i>script</i><b>[</b><i>file</i>...<b>]</b>

sed <b>[</b>-n<b>][</b>-e <i>script</i><b>]</b>...<b>[</b>-f <i>script_file</i><b>]</b>...<b>[</b><i>file</i>...<b>]</b>
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1975">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>sed</i>
utility is a stream editor that reads one or more text files,
makes editing changes according to
a script of editing commands,
and writes the results to standard output.
The script is obtained from either the
<i>script</i>
operand string or a combination of the option-arguments from the
<b>-e</b>&nbsp;<i>script</i>
and
<b>-f</b>&nbsp;<i>script_file</i>
options.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1976">&nbsp;</a>OPTIONS</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>sed</i>
utility supports the <b>XBD</b> specification, <a href="../xbd/utilconv.htm#usg"><b>Utility Syntax Guidelines</b>&nbsp;</a> ,
except that the order of presentation of the
<b>-e</b>
and
<b>-f</b>
options is significant.
<p>
The following options are supported:
<dl compact>

<dt><b>-e&nbsp;</b><i>script</i>
<dd>
Add the editing commands specified by the
<i>script</i>
option-argument to the end of the script of editing commands.
The
<i>script</i>
option-argument has the same properties as the
<i>script</i>
operand, described in the OPERANDS section.

<dt><b>-f&nbsp;</b><i>script_file</i>
<dd>
Add the editing commands in the file
<i>script_file</i>
to the end of the script.

<dt><b>-n</b>
<dd>Suppress the default output
(in which each line, after it is examined
for editing, is written to standard output).
Only lines explicitly selected for output will be written.

</dl>
<p>
Multiple
<b>-e</b>
and
<b>-f</b>
options may be specified.
All commands are
added to the script in the order specified, regardless of their origin.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1977">&nbsp;</a>OPERANDS</h4><blockquote>
The following operands are supported:
<dl compact>

<dt><i>file</i><dd>A pathname of a file whose contents will be read and edited.
If multiple
<i>file</i>
operands are specified, the named files will be read in the
order specified and the concatenation will be edited.
If no
<i>file</i>
operands are specified,
the standard input will be used.

<dt><i>script</i><dd>A string to be used as the script of editing commands.
The application must not present a
<i>script</i>
that violates the restrictions of a text file
except that the final character need not be a
newline character.

</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1978">&nbsp;</a>STDIN</h4><blockquote>
The standard input will be used only if no
<i>file</i>
operands are specified.
See the INPUT FILES section.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1979">&nbsp;</a>INPUT FILES</h4><blockquote>
The input files must be text files.
The
<i>script_file</i>s
named by the
<b>-f</b>
option will consist of editing commands, one per line.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1980">&nbsp;</a>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h4><blockquote>
The following environment variables affect the execution of
<i>sed</i>:
<dl compact>

<dt><i>LANG</i><dd>Provide a default value for the internationalisation variables
that are unset or null.
If
<i>LANG</i>
is unset or null, the corresponding value from the
implementation-dependent default locale will be used.
If any of the internationalisation variables contains an invalid setting, the
utility will behave as if none of the variables had been defined.

<dt><i>LC_ALL</i><dd>
If set to a non-empty string value,
override the values of all the other internationalisation variables.

<dt><i>LC_COLLATE</i><dd>
Determine the locale for the
behaviour of ranges, equivalence classes
and multi-character collating elements
within regular expressions.

<dt><i>LC_CTYPE</i><dd>
Determine the
locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-
versus multi-byte characters in arguments and input files),
and the behaviour of character classes within regular expressions.

<dt><i>LC_MESSAGES</i><dd>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect
the format and contents of diagnostic
messages written to standard error.

<dt><i>NLSPATH</i><dd>
Determine the location of message catalogues
for the processing of
<i>LC_MESSAGES .
</i>
</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1981">&nbsp;</a>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS</h4><blockquote>
Default.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1982">&nbsp;</a>STDOUT</h4><blockquote>
The input files are written to standard output,
with the editing commands specified in
the script applied.
If the
<b>-n</b>
option is specified, only those
input lines selected by the script
will be written to standard output.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1983">&nbsp;</a>STDERR</h4><blockquote>
Used only for diagnostic messages.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1984">&nbsp;</a>OUTPUT FILES</h4><blockquote>
The output files are text files whose formats are
dependent on the editing commands given.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1985">&nbsp;</a>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>script</i>
consists of editing commands, one per line,
of the following form:
<pre>
<dl compact><dt> <dd>
<b>[</b>address<b>[</b>,address<b>]]</b>command<b>[</b>arguments<b>]</b>
</dl>
</pre>
<p>
Zero or more
blank characters
are accepted before the first address and before
<i>command.</i>
<p>
In default operation,
<i>sed</i>
cyclically copies a line of input,
less its terminating
newline character,
into a
<i>pattern space</i>
(unless there is something left after a
<b>D</b>
command),
applies in sequence all commands whose addresses
select that pattern space,
and at the end of the script copies the pattern space
to standard output (except when
<b>-n</b>
is specified) and deletes the pattern space.
Whenever the pattern space is written to standard output
or a named file,
<i>sed</i>
will immediately follow it with a
newline character.
<p>
Some of the commands use a
<i>hold space</i>
to save all or part of the
<i>pattern space</i>
for subsequent retrieval.
The
<i>pattern</i>
and
<i>hold</i>
<i>spaces</i>
will each be able to hold at least 8192 bytes.
<h5><a name = "tag_001_014_1985_001">&nbsp;</a>Addresses in sed</h5>
An address
is either empty, a decimal number that counts
input lines cumulatively across files, a "$"
character that addresses the last line of input,
or a context address
(which consists of a regular expression as described in
<xref href=sedre><a href="#tag_001_014_1985_002">
Regular Expressions in sed
</a></xref>,
preceded and followed by a delimiter, usually a slash).
<p>
A command line with no addresses selects every pattern space.
<p>
A command line with
one address selects each pattern space that matches the address.
<p>
A command line with
two addresses selects the inclusive range from the first
pattern space that matches the first address to
the next pattern space that matches the second.
(If the second address is a number less than or equal
to the line number first selected, only one line will be selected.)
Starting at the first line following the selected range,
<i>sed</i>
looks again for the first address.
Thereafter the process is repeated.
<p>
Editing commands can be applied only to non-selected pattern
spaces by use of the negation command
"!"
(see
<xref href=sedcmds><a href="#tag_001_014_1985_003">
Editing Commands in sed
</a></xref>).
<h5><a name = "tag_001_014_1985_002">&nbsp;</a>Regular Expressions in sed</h5>
<xref type="5" name="sedre"></xref>
The
<i>sed</i>
utility supports the basic regular expressions described in the <b>XBD</b> specification, <a href="../xbd/re.htm#tag_007_003"><b>Basic Regular Expressions</b>&nbsp;</a> ,
with the following additions:
<ul>
<p>
<li>
In a context address, the construction
\cREc
where
<i>c</i>
is any character other than a backslash or newline character,
is identical to
/RE/
If the character designated by
<i>c</i>
appears following a backslash,
then it is considered to be that literal
character, which does not terminate the RE.
For example, in the context address
\xabc\xdefx,
the second
x
stands for itself, so that the
regular expression is
abcxdef.
<p>
<li>
The escape sequence
\n
matches a
newline character
embedded in the pattern space.
A literal
newline
character must not be used in the regular expression
of a context address or in the substitute command.
<p>
</ul>
<h5><a name = "tag_001_014_1985_003">&nbsp;</a>Editing Commands in sed</h5>
<xref type="5" name="sedcmds"></xref>
In the following list of commands, the
maximum number of permissible addresses
for each command is indicated by
<b>[</b><i>0addr</i><b>]</b>,
<b>[</b><i>1addr</i><b>]</b>
or
<b>[</b><i>2addr</i><b>]</b>,
representing zero, one or two addresses.
<p>
The argument
<i>text</i>
consists of one or more lines.
Each embedded
newline character
in the text must be preceded by a backslash.
Other backslashes in text
are removed and the following
character is treated literally.
<p>
The
<b>r</b>
and
<b>w</b>
commands take an optional
<i>rfile</i>
(or
<i>wfile</i>)
parameter, separated from the command letter by
one or more
blank characters;
implementations may allow zero separation as an extension.
<p>
The argument
<i>rfile</i>
or the argument
<i>wfile</i>
terminates the command line.
Each
<i>wfile</i>
will be created before processing begins.
Implementations support at least
ten
<i>wfile</i>
arguments in the script;
the actual number
(greater than or equal to 10)
that will be supported
by the implementation is unspecified.
The use of the
<i>wfile</i>
parameter causes that file to be initially
created, if it does not exist, or
will replace the contents of an existing file.
<p>
The
<b>b</b>,
<b>r</b>,
<b>s</b>,
<b>t</b>,
<b>w</b>,
<b>y</b>,
<b>!</b>
and
<b>:</b>
commands accept additional arguments.
The following synopses indicate which arguments
must be separated from the commands by a single
space character.
<p>
Two of the commands take a
<i>command-list</i>,
which is a list of
<i>sed</i>
commands separated by
newline characters,
as follows:
<pre>
<code>
{ <i>command</i>
<i>command</i>
. . .
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
The
"{"
can be preceded with
blank characters
and can be followed with white space.
The
<i>commands</i>
can be preceded by white space.
The terminating
"}"
must be preceded by a
newline character
and then zero or more
blank characters.
<p>
<dl compact>

<dt><b>[</b><i>2addr</i><b>] {</b><i>command-list</i><dd>
<dt><b>}</b><dd>
Execute
<i>command-list</i>
only when the pattern space is selected.

<dt><b>[</b><i>1addr</i><b>]a\</b><dd>
<dt><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text</i><dd>Write
<i>text</i>
to standard output
just before each attempt to fetch a line of input, whether by
executing the
<b>N</b>
command or by beginning a new cycle.

<dt><b>[</b><i>2addr</i><b>]b&nbsp;[</b><i>label</i><b>]</b><dd>
Branch to the
<b>:</b>
command bearing the
<i>label</i>.
If
<i>label</i>
is not specified, branch to the end of the script.
The implementation supports
<i>labels</i>
recognised as unique up to at least 8 characters;
the actual length (greater than or equal to 8) that is supported
by the implementation is unspecified.
It is unspecified whether exceeding a label length
causes an error or a silent truncation.

<dt><b>[</b><i>2addr</i><b>]c\</b><dd>
<dt><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text</i><dd>Delete the pattern space.
With a 0 or 1 address or at the end of a 2-address range, place
<i>text</i>
on the output.

<dt><b>[</b><i>2addr</i><b>]d</b><dd>
Delete the pattern space and start the next cycle.

<dt><b>[</b><i>2addr</i><b>]D</b><dd>
Delete the initial segment of the pattern space up to and including
the first
newline character
and start the next cycle.

<dt><b>[</b><i>2addr</i><b>]g</b><dd>
Replace the contents of the pattern space
by the contents of the hold space.

<dt><b>[</b><i>2addr</i><b>]G</b><dd>
Append to the pattern space a
newline character
followed by the contents of the hold space.

<dt><b>[</b><i>2addr</i><b>]h</b><dd>
Replace the contents of the hold space
with the contents of the pattern space.

<dt><b>[</b><i>2addr</i><b>]H</b><dd>
Append to the hold space a
newline character
followed by the contents of the pattern space.

<dt><b>[</b><i>1addr</i><b>]i\</b><dd>
<dt><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text</i><dd>Write
<i>text</i>
to standard output.

<dt><b>[</b><i>2addr</i><b>]l</b><dd>
(The letter ell.)
Write the pattern space to standard output in a
visually unambiguous form.
The characters listed in the table in
the <b>XBD</b> specification, <a href="../xbd/notation.htm"><b>File Format Notation</b>&nbsp;</a> 
(\\,
\a,
\b,
\f,
\r,
\t,
\v)
will be written as the corresponding escape sequence;
the
\n
in that table is not applicable.
Non-printable characters not in that table
will be written as one three-digit octal number
(with a preceding
backslash character)
for each byte in the character (most significant byte first).
If the size of a byte on the system is greater than nine bits,
the format used for non-printable characters is implementation-dependent.

Long lines will be folded, with the point of
folding indicated by writing a
backslash followed by a
newline character;
the length at which folding occurs is unspecified,
but should be appropriate for the output device.
The end of each line will be marked with a "$".

<dt><b>[</b><i>2addr</i><b>]n</b><dd>
Write the pattern space to standard output
if the default output has not been suppressed, and
replace the pattern space with the next line of input.

<dt><b>[</b><i>2addr</i><b>]N</b><dd>
Append the next line of input to the pattern space, using
an embedded
newline character
to separate the appended material from the original material.
Note that the current line number changes.

<dt><b>[</b><i>2addr</i><b>]p</b><dd>
Write the pattern space to standard output.

<dt><b>[</b><i>2addr</i><b>]P</b><dd>
Write the pattern space, up to the first
newline character,
to standard output.

<dt><b>[</b><i>1addr</i><b>]q</b><dd>
Branch to the end of the script and quit without starting a new cycle.

<dt><b>[</b><i>1addr</i><b>]</b>r <i>rfile</i><dd>
Copy the contents of
<i>rfile</i>
to standard output
just before each attempt to fetch a line of input.
If
<i>rfile</i>
does not exist or cannot be read,
it is treated as if it were an empty file,
causing no error condition.

<dt><b>[</b><i>2addr</i><b>]s/</b><i>regular expression</i><b>/</b><i>replacement</i><b>/</b><i>flags</i><dd>
Substitute the
<i>replacement</i>
string for instances of the
<i>regular expression</i>
in the pattern space.
Any character other than
backslash
or
newline
can be used instead of a slash to
delimit the RE and the replacement.
Within the RE and the replacement,
the RE delimiter itself can be used as a literal
character if it is preceded by a backslash.

An ampersand (<b>&amp;</b>) appearing in the
<i>replacement</i>
will be replaced by the string matching the RE.
The special meaning of "&amp;" in this context can be
suppressed by preceding it by backslash.
The characters
<b>\</b><i>n</i>,
where
<i>n</i>
is a digit,
will be replaced by the text matched by the
corresponding backreference expression.
For each backslash (\) encountered in scanning
<i>replacement</i>
from beginning to end, the following character loses its special meaning
(if any).
It is unspecified what special meaning is given to any character
other than &amp;, \ or digits.

A line can be split by substituting a
newline
character into it.
The application must escape the
newline character
in the
<i>replacement</i>
by preceding it by backslash.
A substitution is considered to have been
performed even if the replacement string is identical to the
string that it replaces.

The value of
<i>flags</i>
must be zero or more of:
<dl compact>

<dt><i>n</i><dd>Substitute for the <i>n</i>th occurrence only of the
<i>regular expression</i>
found within the pattern space.

<dt><b>g</b><dd>Globally substitute for all non-overlapping instances of the
<i>regular expression</i>
rather than just the
first one.
If both
g
and
<i>n</i>
are specified,
the results are unspecified.

<dt><b>p</b><dd>Write the pattern space to standard output if a replacement was made.

<dt><b>w</b> <i>wfile</i><dd>Write.
Append the pattern space to
<i>wfile</i>
if a replacement was made.

</dl>
<br>
<p>
<dt><b>[</b><i>2addr</i><b>]t&nbsp;[</b><i>label</i><b>]</b><dd>
Test.
Branch to the
<b>:</b>
command bearing the
<i>label</i>
if any
substitutions have been made since the most recent
reading of an input line or execution of a
<b>t</b>.
If
<i>label</i>
is not specified, branch to the end of the script.
<p>
<dt><b>[</b><i>2addr</i><b>]w</b> <i>wfile</i><dd>
Append (write) the pattern space to
<i>wfile</i>.
<p>
<dt><b>[</b><i>2addr</i><b>]x</b><dd>
Exchange the contents of the pattern and hold spaces.
<p>
<dt><b>[</b><i>2addr</i><b>]y/</b><i>string1</i><b>/</b><i>string2</i><b>/</b><dd>
Replace all occurrences of characters in
<i>string1</i>
with the corresponding characters in
<i>string2</i>.
If the number of characters in
<i>string1</i>
and
<i>string2</i>
are not equal, or if any of the characters in
<i>string1</i>
appear more than once, the results are undefined.
Any character other than backslash or newline
can be used instead of slash to delimit the strings.
Within
<i>string1</i>
and
<i>string2</i>,
the delimiter itself can be used as a literal
character if it is preceded by a backslash.
<p>
<dt><b>[</b><i>2addr</i><b>]!</b><i>command</i><dd><p>
<dt><b>[</b><i>2addr</i><b>]!{</b><i>command-list</i><dd><p>
<dt><b>}</b><dd>Apply the
<i>command</i>
or
<i>command-list</i>
only to the lines that are not
selected by the addresses.
<p>
<dt><b>[</b><i>0addr</i><b>]:</b><i>label</i><dd>
This command does nothing; it bears a
<i>label</i>
for the
<b>b</b>
and
<b>t</b>
commands to branch to.
<p>
<dt><b>[</b><i>1addr</i><b>]=</b><dd>
Write the following to standard output:
<p><code>
<tt>"%d\n"</tt>, &lt;<i>current line number</i>&gt;
</code>
<p>
<dt><b>[</b><i>0addr</i><b>]</b><dd>An empty command is ignored.
<p>
<dt><b>[</b><i>0addr</i><b>]#</b><dd>
The
"#"
and the remainder of the line are ignored
(treated as a comment), with the single exception that
if the first two characters in the file are
#n,
the default output is suppressed;
this is the equivalent of specifying
<b>-n</b>
on the command line.

Default.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1988">&nbsp;</a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4><blockquote>
Regular expressions match entire strings,
not just individual lines,
but a
newline character
is matched by
\n
in a
<i>sed</i>
RE; a newline character is not allowed in an RE.
Also note that
\n
cannot be used to match a
newline character
at the end of an arbitrary input line;
newline characters
appear in the pattern space as a result of the
<b>N</b>
editing command.
<br>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1989">&nbsp;</a>EXAMPLES</h4><blockquote>
This
<i>sed</i>
script simulates the BSD
<i><a href="cat.htm">cat</a></i>
<b>-s</b>
command, squeezing excess blank lines from standard input.
<pre>
<code>
