<pre><code>

</code>
</pre>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_113">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>col</i>
utility
reads from the standard input and writes to the standard output.
It performs the line overlays implied by reverse line-feeds,
and by forward and reverse half-line-feeds.
Unless
<b>-x</b>
is used, all
blank characters
in the input will be converted to
tab characters
wherever possible.
<p>
The
ASCII
control characters
SO
and
SI
are assumed by
<i>col</i>
to start and end text in an alternative character set.
The character set to which each input character belongs is remembered,
and on output
SI
and
SO
characters are generated as appropriate to ensure
that each character is written in the correct character set.
<p>
On input, the only control characters accepted are
space,
backspace,
tab,
carriage-return
and
newline characters,
SI,
SO,
VT,
reverse line-feed, forward half-line-feed and
reverse half-line-feed.
The
VT
character is an alternative form of full reverse line-feed,
included for
compatibility with some earlier programs of this type.
The only other characters to be copied to the output are
those that are printable.
<p>
The ASCII codes for the control functions and line-motion
sequences mentioned above are as given in the table below.
ESC stands for the ASCII escape character, with the octal code 033;
ESC<b>-x</b> means a sequence of two characters,
ESC followed by the character
<b>x</b>.

</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_114">&nbsp;</a>OPTIONS</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>col</i>
utility supports the <b>XBD</b> specification, <a href="../xbd/utilconv.htm#usg"><b>Utility Syntax Guidelines</b>&nbsp;</a> .
The following options are supported:
<dl compact>

<dt><b>-b</b>
<dd>Assume that the output device in use is not capable of backspacing.
In this case, if two or more characters are to appear in the same place,
only the last one read will be output.

<dt><b>-f</b>
<dd>Suppress the normal treatment of half-line motions.
Although
<i>col</i>
accepts half-line motions in its input, it normally does not
emit them on output.
Instead, text that would appear between lines is moved to the next lower
full-line boundary.
By suppressing this treatment, the output from
<i>col</i>
may contain forward half-line-feeds,
but will still never contain either kind of reverse-line motion.

<dt><b>-p</b>
<dd>Force escape sequences to be passed through unchanged.
Normally,
<i>col</i>
will remove any escape sequences found in its input that are
not specified above.

<dt><b>-x</b>
<dd>Prevent
<i>col</i>
from converting
blank characters
to
tab characters
on output wherever possible.
Tab stops are considered to be at each column position
<i>n</i>
such that
<i>n</i>
modulo 8 equals 1.

</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_115">&nbsp;</a>OPERANDS</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_116">&nbsp;</a>STDIN</h4><blockquote>
The standard input is a text file to be translated.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_117">&nbsp;</a>INPUT FILES</h4><blockquote>
None.
<br>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_118">&nbsp;</a>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h4><blockquote>
The following environment variables may affect the execution of
<i>col</i>:
<dl compact>

<dt><i>LANG</i><dd>Provide a default value for the internationalisation variables
that are unset or null.
If
<i>LANG</i>
is unset or null, the corresponding value from the
implementation-dependent default locale will be used.
If any of the internationalisation variables contains an invalid setting, the
utility will behave as if none of the variables had been defined.

<dt><i>LC_ALL</i><dd>
If set to a non-empty string value,
override the values of all the other internationalisation variables.

<dt><i>LC_CTYPE</i><dd>
Determine the
locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single- as opposed to multi-byte characters
in arguments and input files).

<dt><i>LC_MESSAGES</i><dd>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect
the format and contents of diagnostic
messages written to standard error.

<dt><i>NLSPATH</i><dd>
Determine the location of message catalogues
for the processing of
<i>LC_MESSAGES .
</i>

</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_119">&nbsp;</a>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS</h4><blockquote>
Default.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_120">&nbsp;</a>STDOUT</h4><blockquote>
The standard output is a text file, translated from the
standard input.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_121">&nbsp;</a>STDERR</h4><blockquote>
Used only for diagnostic messages.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_122">&nbsp;</a>OUTPUT FILES</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_123">&nbsp;</a>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_124">&nbsp;</a>EXIT STATUS</h4><blockquote>
The following exit values are returned:
<dl compact>

<dt>0<dd>Successful completion.

<dt>&gt;0<dd>An error occurred.

</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_125">&nbsp;</a>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS</h4><blockquote>
Default.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_126">&nbsp;</a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4><blockquote>
The use of the
<b>-x</b>
option may increase or decrease printing time,
depending on the printer type.
<p>
Local vertical motions that would result in backing up over the first
line of the document are ignored.
As a result, the first line must not have any superscripts.
<p>
The use of the
<b>-f</b>
or
<b>-p</b>
options is discouraged unless the user
is aware of the consequences of passing unusual escape sequences
to the terminal.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_127">&nbsp;</a>EXAMPLES</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_128">&nbsp;</a>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_129">&nbsp;</a>SEE ALSO</h4><blockquote>
