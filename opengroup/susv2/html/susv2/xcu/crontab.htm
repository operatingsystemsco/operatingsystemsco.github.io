<h4><a name = "tag_001_014_225">&nbsp;</a>NAME</h4><blockquote>
crontab - schedule periodic background work
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_226">&nbsp;</a>SYNOPSIS</h4><blockquote>
<pre><code>

crontab <b>[</b><i>file</i><b>]</b>

crontab <b>[</b> -e | -l | -r <b>]</b>
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_227">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>crontab</i>
utility creates, replaces or edits a user's
<i>crontab</i>
entry;
a crontab entry is a list of commands and the times
at which they are to be executed.
The new crontab entry can be input by specifying
<i>file</i>
or input from standard input if no
<i>file</i>
operand is specified,
or by using an editor, if
<b>-e</b>
is specified.
<p>
Upon execution of a command from a crontab entry,
the implementation will supply
a default environment, defining at least
the following environment variables:
<dl compact>

<dt><i>HOME</i><dd>A pathname of the user's home directory.

<dt><i>LOGNAME</i><dd>
The user's login name.

<dt><i>PATH</i><dd>A string representing a search path guaranteed
to find all of the standard utilities.

<dt><i>SHELL</i><dd>A pathname of the
command interpreter.
When
<i>crontab</i>
is invoked as specified by this specification,
the value will be a pathname for
<i><a href="sh.htm">sh</a></i>.

</dl>
<p>
The values of these variables when
<i>crontab</i>
is invoked as specified by this specification
will not affect the default values provided
when the scheduled command is run.
<p>
If standard output and standard error are not redirected
by commands executed from the crontab entry,
any generated output or errors will be
mailed, via an implementation-dependent method, to the user.
<p>
Users are permitted to use
<i>crontab</i>
if their names appear in the file
<b>/usr/lib/cron/cron.allow</b>.
If that file does not exist, the file
<b>/usr/lib/cron/cron.deny</b>
is checked to determine if the user
should be denied access to
<i>crontab</i>.
If neither file exists, only a process with appropriate privileges is
allowed to submit a job.
If only
<b>cron.deny</b>
exists and is empty, global usage is permitted.
The
<b>cron.allow</b>
and
<b>cron.deny</b>
files consist of one user name per line.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_228">&nbsp;</a>OPTIONS</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>crontab</i>
utility supports the <b>XBD</b> specification, <a href="../xbd/utilconv.htm#usg"><b>Utility Syntax Guidelines</b>&nbsp;</a> .
<p>
The following options are supported:
<dl compact>

<dt><b>-e</b>
<dd>Edit a copy of the invoking user's crontab entry,
or create an empty entry to edit if the crontab
entry does not exist.
When editing is complete,
the entry will be installed as the user's crontab entry.

<dt><b>-l</b>
<dd>(The letter ell.)
List the invoking user's crontab entry.

<dt><b>-r</b>
<dd>Remove the invoking user's crontab entry.

</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_229">&nbsp;</a>OPERANDS</h4><blockquote>
The following operand is supported:
<dl compact>

<dt><i>file</i><dd>The pathname of a file that contains specifications, in the format
defined in the INPUT FILES section, for crontab entries.

</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_230">&nbsp;</a>STDIN</h4><blockquote>
See the INPUT FILES section.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_231">&nbsp;</a>INPUT FILES</h4><blockquote>
In the POSIX locale, a
crontab
entry must be a text file consisting of lines of six fields each.
The fields must be separated by
blank characters.
The first five fields must be integer patterns that
specify the following:
<ol>
<p>
<li>
Minute (0-59)
<p>
<li>
Hour (0-23)
<p>
<li>
Day of the month (1-31)
<p>
<li>
Month of the year (1-12)
<p>
<li>
Day of the week (0-6 with 0=Sunday).
<p>
</ol>
<p>
Each of these patterns can
be either an asterisk (meaning all valid values),
an element
or a list of elements separated by commas.
An element must be either a number or
two numbers separated by a hyphen
(meaning an inclusive range).
The specification of days
can be made by two fields
(day of the month and day of the week).
If month, day of month and day of week are all
asterisks, every day will be matched.
If either the month or day
of month is specified as an element or list, but the day of
week is an asterisk, the month and day of month fields
will specify the days that match.
If both month and day of month
are specified as asterisk, but day of week is an element or
list, then only the specified days of the week will match.
Finally, if either the month or day of month is specified as
an element or list, and the day of week is also specified as
an element or list, then any day matching either the month
and day of month or the day of week, will be matched.
<p>
The sixth field of a line in a crontab
entry is a string that will be executed by
<i><a href="sh.htm">sh</a></i>
at the specified times.
A percent sign character in this field will be translated to a
newline
character.
Any character preceded by a backslash (including the
%)
causes that character to be treated literally.
Only the first line (up to a "%" or end-of-line)
of the command field will be executed by the command interpreter.
The other lines will be made available to the
command as standard input.
<p>
Blank lines and those whose first non-blank
character is
"#"
will be ignored.
<p>
The text files
<b>/usr/lib/cron/cron.allow</b>
and
<b>/usr/lib/cron/cron.deny</b>
contain user names, one per line, of users who are, respectively,
authorised or denied access to the service underlying the
<i>crontab</i>
utility.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_232">&nbsp;</a>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h4><blockquote>
The following environment variables affect the execution of
<i>crontab</i>:
<dl compact>

<dt><i>EDITOR</i><dd>
Determine the editor to be invoked when the
<b>-e</b>
option is specified.
The default editor is
<i><a href="vi.htm">vi</a></i>.

<dt><i>LANG</i><dd>Provide a default value for the internationalisation variables
that are unset or null.
If
<i>LANG</i>
is unset or null, the corresponding value from the
implementation-dependent default locale will be used.
If any of the internationalisation variables contains an invalid setting, the
utility will behave as if none of the variables had been defined.

<dt><i>LC_ALL</i><dd>
If set to a non-empty string value,
override the values of all the other internationalisation variables.

<dt><i>LC_CTYPE</i><dd>
Determine the
locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single- as opposed to multi-byte characters
in arguments and input files).

<dt><i>LC_MESSAGES</i><dd>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect
the format and contents of diagnostic
messages written to standard error.

<dt><i>NLSPATH</i><dd>
Determine the location of message catalogues
for the processing of
<i>LC_MESSAGES .
</i>
</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_233">&nbsp;</a>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS</h4><blockquote>
Default.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_234">&nbsp;</a>STDOUT</h4><blockquote>
If the
<b>-l</b>
option is specified, the crontab entry will be written to
the standard output.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_235">&nbsp;</a>STDERR</h4><blockquote>
Used only for diagnostic messages.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_236">&nbsp;</a>OUTPUT FILES</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_237">&nbsp;</a>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_238">&nbsp;</a>EXIT STATUS</h4><blockquote>
The following exit values are returned:
<dl compact>

<dt>0<dd>Successful completion.

<dt>&gt;0<dd>An error occurred.

</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_239">&nbsp;</a>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS</h4><blockquote>
The user's crontab entry is not submitted, removed, edited or listed.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_240">&nbsp;</a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4><blockquote>
The format of the
<i>crontab</i>
entry shown here is guaranteed only for the POSIX locale.
Other cultures may be supported with substantially different
interfaces, although implementations are encouraged to provide
comparable levels of functionality.
<p>
The default settings of the
<i>HOME ,
</i><i>LOGNAME ,
</i><i>PATH</i>
and
<i>SHELL</i>
variables that are given to the scheduled job are
not affected by the settings of those variables when
<i>crontab</i>
is run; as stated, they are defaults.
The text about &quot;invoked as specified by this specification&quot;
means that the implementation may provide extensions
that allow these variables to be affected
at runtime, but that the user has to take explicit
action in order to access the extension,
such as give a new option flag or modify the
format of the crontab entry.
<p>
A typical user error is to type only
<i>crontab</i>;
this will cause the system to wait for the new crontab
entry on standard input.
If end-of-file is typed (generally
&lt;control&gt;-D),
the crontab entry will be replaced by an empty file.
In this case, the user should type the interrupt character,
which will prevent the crontab entry from being replaced.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_241">&nbsp;</a>EXAMPLES</h4><blockquote>
<ol>
<p>
<li>
Clean up
<b>core</b>
files every weekday morning at 3:15 am:
<pre>
<code>
15 3 * * 1-5 find $HOME -name core 2&gt;/dev/null | xargs rm -f
</code>
</pre>
<p>
<li>
Mail a birthday greeting:
<pre>
<code>
0 12 14 2 * mailx john%Happy Birthday!%Time for lunch.
</code>
</pre>
<br>
<p>
<li>
As an example of specifying the two types of days:
<pre>
<code>
0 0 1,15 * 1
</code>
</pre>
would run a command on the
first and fifteenth of each month, as well as on every Monday.
To specify days by only one field,
the other field should be set to "*"; for example:
<pre>
<code>
0 0 * * 1
</code>
</pre>
would run a command only on Mondays.
<p>
</ol>
