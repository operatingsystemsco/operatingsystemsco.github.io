<h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2220">&nbsp;</a>NAME</h4><blockquote>
tar - file archiver (<b><a href="intro.htm#tag_001_003_003">LEGACY</a></b>)
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2221">&nbsp;</a>SYNOPSIS</h4><blockquote>
<pre><code>

tar <i>key </i><b>[</b><i>file</i>...<b>]</b>
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2222">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>tar</i>
utility
processes archives of files.
Its actions are controlled by the
<i>key</i>
operand.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2223">&nbsp;</a>OPTIONS</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2224">&nbsp;</a>OPERANDS</h4><blockquote>
The following operands are supported:
<dl compact>

<dt><i>key</i><dd>The
<i>key</i>
operand consists of a function letter followed immediately
by zero or more modifying letters.

The function letter is one of the following:

<dl compact>

<dt><b>r</b><dd>Write the named
<i>file</i>
or files
on the end of the archive.
If the archive is on a magnetic tape device,
the results are unspecified.

<dt><b>x</b><dd>Extract the named
<i>file</i>
or files
from the archive.
If a named file matches a directory whose contents
had been written onto the archive,
this directory is (recursively) extracted.
If a named file in the archive does not exist on the system,
the file is created with the same mode as
the one in the archive, except that the
set-user-ID and set-group-ID modes are not set
unless the user has appropriate privileges.
If the files exist, their modes are not changed except as
described above.
The owner, group, and modification time are restored (if possible).
If no
<i>file</i>
operand is given, the entire content of the archive is extracted.
Note that if several files with the same name
are in the archive, the last one overwrites all earlier ones.

<dt><b>t</b><dd>Write to standard output the names of all the files in the archive.

<dt><b>u</b><dd>Add the named
<i>file</i>
or files
to the archive if they are not already there, or have
been modified since last written into the archive.
If the archive is on a magnetic tape device,
the results are unspecified.

<dt><b>c</b><dd>Create a new archive; writing begins at the beginning
of the archive, instead of after the last file.

</dl>
<p>
The following characters can be
appended to the function letter.
Appending the same character more than once
produces undefined results.
The order of the
b
and
f
characters is significant.
<p>
<dl compact>

<dt><b>v</b><dd>(Verbose.)
Write to standard error the name of each file processed,
preceded by a string indicating the operation being performed,
as follows:
<table  bordercolor=#000000 border=1 align=center><tr valign=top><th align=center><b>Key Letter</b>
<th align=center><b>String</b>
<tr valign=top><td align=center>c, r, u
<td align=center>"a "
<tr valign=top><td align=center>x
<td align=center>"x "
</table>

The filename may be followed by additional
information, such as the size of the file
in the archive or file system, in an unspecified format.
When used with the
t
function letter,
v
writes to standard output more information about the
archive entries than just the name.

<dt><b>w</b><dd>Write the action to be taken,
followed by the name of the file, and then
wait for the user's confirmation.
If an affirmative response is given, the action is performed.
Any other input suppresses the action.


<dt><b>f</b><dd>Use the first
<i>file</i>
operand (or the second, if
b
has already been specified)
as the name of the archive instead
of the system-dependent default.
If the name of the file is -,
<i>tar</i>
writes to the standard output or reads
from the standard input, whichever is appropriate.
Thus,
<i>tar</i>
can be used as the head or tail of a pipeline.
The
<i>tar</i>
utility
can also be used to move directory
hierarchies with the command:
<pre>
<code>
(cd fromdir; tar cf - . ) | (cd todir; tar xf -)
</code>
</pre>

<dt><b>b</b><dd>Use the first
<i>file</i>
operand (or the second, if
f
has already been specified)
as the blocking factor for tape records.
The default is not greater than 20; the maximum is not less than 20.
This modifier
should only be used with raw magnetic tape archives (see
f
above).
The block size is determined automatically when reading
tapes (function letters
x
and
t).

<dt><b>l</b><dd>Report if all of the links
to the files being archived cannot be resolved.
If
l
is not specified, no error messages are written.

<dt><b>m</b><dd>Do not restore the modification times.
The modification time of the file
will be the time of extraction.

<dt><b>o</b><dd>Assign to extracted files
the user and group identifier of
the user running the program
rather than those on the archive.

</dl>
<p>
<dt><i>file</i><dd>A pathname of a regular file or directory to be archived
(when the
c,
r
or
u
function letters are used),
extracted (<i>x</i> )
or listed (<i>t</i> ).
When
<i>file</i>
is the pathname of a directory, the action applies to
all of the files and (recursively) subdirectories of that directory.
When either or both of the
b
or
f
letters are used in the
<i>key</i>
operand, the initial
<i>file</i>
operands are interpreted as a blocking factor or archive name,
as described previously.
<p>
</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2225">&nbsp;</a>STDIN</h4><blockquote>
When the
f
modifier is used with the
t
or
x
function letter and the pathname is -, the standard input
is an archive file formatted as specified by
<i><a href="pax.htm">pax</a></i>
with the
<b>-x ustar</b>
option.
Otherwise, the standard input is not used.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2226">&nbsp;</a>INPUT FILES</h4><blockquote>
The files identified by the
<i>file</i>
operands are regular files or directories.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2227">&nbsp;</a>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h4><blockquote>
The following environment variables may affect the execution of
<i>tar</i>:
<dl compact>

<dt><i>LANG</i><dd>Provide a default value for the internationalisation variables
that are unset or null.
If
<i>LANG</i>
is unset or null, the corresponding value from the
implementation-dependent default locale will be used.
If any of the internationalisation variables contains an invalid setting, the
utility will behave as if none of the variables had been defined.

<dt><i>LC_ALL</i><dd>
If set to a non-empty string value,
override the values of all the other internationalisation variables.

<dt><i>LC_COLLATE</i><dd>
Determine the locale for the
behaviour of ranges, equivalence classes
and multi-character collating elements
used in the extended regular expression defined for the
<b>yesexpr</b>
locale keyword in the LC_MESSAGES category.

<dt><i>LC_CTYPE</i><dd>
Determine the
locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single- as opposed to multi-byte characters
in arguments and input files)
and the behaviour of character classes
used in the extended regular expression defined for the
<b>yesexpr</b>
locale keyword in the LC_MESSAGES category.

<dt><i>LC_MESSAGES</i><dd>
Determine the locale for the processing of affirmative responses
and that should be used to affect
the format and contents of diagnostic
messages written to standard error.

<dt><i>LC_TIME</i><dd>
Determine the format of date and time strings output when
listing the contents of an archive with the
v
modifier; for example:
<pre>
<code>
tar&nbsp;tvf&nbsp;/dev/tape
</code>
</pre>

<dt><i>NLSPATH</i><dd>
Determine the location of message catalogues
for the processing of
<i>LC_MESSAGES .
</i>
<dt><i>TZ</i><dd>Determine the timezone used with date and time strings.

</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2228">&nbsp;</a>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS</h4><blockquote>
Default.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2229">&nbsp;</a>STDOUT</h4><blockquote>
When the
f
modifier is used with the
r,
u
or
c
function letter and the pathname is -, the standard output
is an archive file formatted as specified by
<i><a href="pax.htm">pax</a></i>
with the
<b>-x ustar</b>
option.
When the
t
function letter is used, the standard output
consists of the names of the files in the archive,
separated by
newline characters;
if
v
is used with
t,
the standard output includes additional information
in an unspecified format.
Otherwise, the standard output is not used.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2230">&nbsp;</a>STDERR</h4><blockquote>
The standard error is
used for diagnostic messages and the filename output
described under the
v
modifier (when the
t
function letter is not used).
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2231">&nbsp;</a>OUTPUT FILES</h4><blockquote>
Output files are created, as specified by the archive, when the
x
function letter is used.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2232">&nbsp;</a>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2233">&nbsp;</a>EXIT STATUS</h4><blockquote>
The following exit values are returned:
<dl compact>

<dt>0<dd>Successful completion.

<dt>&gt;0<dd>An error occurred.

</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2234">&nbsp;</a>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS</h4><blockquote>
Default.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2235">&nbsp;</a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4><blockquote>
Some systems have usually had blocking factors in the
range 1 to at least 127 with a default of 20 while other
systems have usually had blocking factors in the range 1
to 20 with a default of 1.
For maximum portability,
applications should specify a blocking factor no larger than 20.
<p>
For portable communication of data between XSI-conformant systems, it is
recommended that only characters defined in the
ISO/IEC&nbsp;646:1991 standard International Reference Version
(equivalent to ASCII) 7-bit range of
characters be used and that only characters defined in the Portable
Filename Character Set be used for naming files.
This recommendation
is given because XSI-conformant systems support diverse codesets and run in
various geographical areas and there is no single, well established
codeset that incorporates all of the characters of the languages of
the various geographical areas.
<p>
Note that the
<i>tar</i>
format can only support files up to 8 gigabytes in size.
<p>
Applications should migrate to the
<i><a href="pax.htm">pax</a></i>
utility.
