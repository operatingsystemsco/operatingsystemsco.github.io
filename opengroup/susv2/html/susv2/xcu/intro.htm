<h3><a name = "tag_001_001">&nbsp;</a>Overview</h3>
The XCU specification defines the shell command language
and the utilities provided by the X/Open System Interface (XSI).
The utilities are accessed using commands
given to command interpreters supporting
the shell command language.
The system interfaces and headers (described in CAE Specification, <b>System Interfaces and Headers</b>, <b>Issue 5</b>) and the utilities
are jointly known as services to application programs.
No particular restrictions are imposed on the way in
which the services are implemented.
<p>
The utilities are defined in terms of their interface as seen
from the
<i>sh</i>
command interpreter.
Alternative interfaces are available to application programs through
one of the
functions, and the
<i><a href="../xsh/popen.htm">popen()</a></i>
and
<i><a href="../xsh/system.htm">system()</a></i>
interfaces, all of which are described in CAE Specification, <b>System Interfaces and Headers</b>, <b>Issue 5</b>.
<h3><a name = "tag_001_002">&nbsp;</a>Conformance</h3>
<xref type="2" name="conformance"></xref>
An implementation conforming to this specification shall
meet the following criteria:
<ul>
<p>
<li>
The system shall provide all the utilities described in this specification
with all the functionality defined, subject to the following:
<ul>
<p>
<li>
Development utilities listed in
<xref href=dev><a href="#tag_001_003_001">
Development
</a></xref>
need not be provided.
<p>
<li>
FORTRAN utilities listed in
<xref href=fortran><a href="#tag_001_003_002">
FORTRAN
</a></xref>
need not be provided.
<p>
<li>
Legacy utilities listed in
<xref href=legacy><a href="#tag_001_003_003">
LEGACY
</a></xref>
need not be provided.
<p>
<li>
Within the utilities that are provided, functionality marked by the codes
<small>OF</small>, <small>OP</small>, <small>PI</small>, or <small>UN</small>
need not be provided.
<p>
</ul>
<p>
<li>
The system may provide one or more of the following:
<ul>
<p>
<li>
development utilities (as a group) listed in
<xref href=dev><a href="#tag_001_003_001">
Development
</a></xref>
<p>
<li>
the FORTRAN77 compiler listed in
<xref href=fortran><a href="#tag_001_003_002">
FORTRAN
</a></xref>.
<p>
</ul>
<p>
When an implementation claims that an optional or possibly unsupportable
facility is provided, all of its constituent parts shall be provided
and shall comply with the specification.
<p>
When an implementation claims that a development system is provided,
all of the utilities marked <b>DEVELOPMENT</b> and listed in
<xref href=dev><a href="#tag_001_003_001">
Development
</a></xref>,
except
<i><a href="dis.htm">dis</a></i>,
shall be provided and shall comply with the specification.
<p>
When an implementation claims that a FORTRAN system is provided,
the utility marked <b>FORTRAN</b> and listed in
<xref href=fortran><a href="#tag_001_003_002">
FORTRAN
</a></xref>
shall be provided and shall comply with the specification.
<dl><dt><b>Note:</b>
<dd>To determine whether an implementation supports development, FORTRAN
or possibly unsupportable utilities, refer to the implementation's
Conformance Statement.
</dl>
<p>
<li>
The system may provide additional or enhanced utilities and facilities
not required by this specification, provided that such additions or
enhancements do not affect the behaviour of an application
that requires only the facilities described in this specification.
<p>
</ul>
<p>
An implementation conforming to this specification depends on the environment
provided by the system interfaces and headers specified in the referenced
<b>XSH</b> specification.  For further information, refer to the <b>XSH</b> specification, <b>Section 1.2</b>,
<b>Conformance</b>, the referenced <b>XPG4, Version 2</b> document and
the implementation's Conformance Statement.
<h4><a name = "tag_001_002_001">&nbsp;</a>Symbolic Links</h4>
The definition of symbolic links in the <b>XBD</b> specification, <a href="../xbd/glossary.htm"><b>Glossary</b>&nbsp;</a>  was new in
Issue 4, Version 2.
An implementation need not support symbolic links to be conformant with this
document.  (See the <b>XSH</b> specification, <b>Section 1.2, Conformance</b> for the implications
on conformance with the <b>XSH</b> specification.)
<p>
The definition of pathname resolution in the <b>XBD</b> specification, <a href="../xbd/glossary.htm"><b>Glossary</b>&nbsp;</a>  indicates the effects of
symbolic links.  However, many utilities that manipulate files may manipulate
symbolic links.  Use of these utilities in this context (that is, when the
last component of the pathname is a symbolic link) produces unspecified
effects.  In addition, if any utility encounters a symbolic link after
pathname resolution has been completed, the effects are unspecified.
<p>
<h4><a name = "tag_001_002_002">&nbsp;</a>Considerations for Utilities in Support of Files of Arbitrary Size</h4>
The following utilities will support files of any size up to the
maximum that can be created by the implementation.  This support
includes correct writing of file size-related values (such as file
sizes and offsets, line numbers, and block counts) and correct
interpretation of command line arguments that contain such values. 
<dl compact>

<dt><i>basename</i><dd>Return non-directory portion of pathname.

<dt><i>cat</i><dd>Concatenate and print files.

<dt><i>cd</i><dd>Change working directory.

<dt><i>chgrp</i><dd>Change file group ownership.

<dt><i>chmod</i><dd>Change file modes.

<dt><i>chown</i><dd>Change file ownership.

<dt><i>cksum</i><dd>Write file checksums and sizes.

<dt><i>cmp</i><dd>Compare two files.

<dt><i>cp</i><dd>Copy files.

<dt><i>dd</i><dd>Convert and copy a file.

<dt><i>df</i><dd>Report free disk space.

<dt><i>dirname</i><dd>Return directory portion of pathname.

<dt><i>du</i><dd>Estimate file space usage.

<dt><i>find</i><dd>Find files.

<dt><i>ln</i><dd>Link files.

<dt><i>ls</i><dd>List directory contents.

<dt><i>mkdir</i><dd>Make directories.

<dt><i>mv</i><dd>Move files.

<dt><i>pathchk</i><dd>Check pathnames.

<dt><i>pwd</i><dd>Return working directory name.

<dt><i>rm</i><dd>Remove directory entries.

<dt><i>rmdir</i><dd>Remove directories.

<dt><i>sh</i><dd>Shell, the standard command language interpreter.

<dt><i>sum</i><dd>Print checksum and block or byte count of a file.

<dt><i>test</i><dd>Evaluate expression.

<dt><i>touch</i><dd>Change file access and modification times.

<dt><i>ulimit</i><dd>Set or report file size limit.

</dl>
<p>
Exceptions to the requirement that utilities support files of any size
up to the maximum are: 
<ol>
<p>
<li>
Utilities such as 
<i><a href="tar.htm">tar</a></i>
and 
<i><a href="cpio.htm">cpio</a></i>
cannot support arbitrary file sizes
due to limitations imposed by fixed file formats. 
<p>
<li>
Uses of files as
command scripts, or for configuration or control, are exempt. For
example, it is not required that 
<i><a href="sh.htm">sh</a></i>
be able to read an arbitrarily large &quot;.profile&quot;. 
<p>
<li>
Shell input and output redirection are exempt. For
example, it is not required that the redirections
<i>sum &lt; file</i>
or
<i>echo foo &gt; file</i>
succeed for an arbitrarily large existing file. 
<p>
</ol>
<h3><a name = "tag_001_003">&nbsp;</a>Options</h3>
<p>
Utilities marked <b>DEVELOPMENT</b>, <b>FORTRAN</b> or <b>LEGACY</b> are optional.
See
<xref href=conformance><a href="#tag_001_002">
Conformance
</a></xref>
for conformance requirements.
<h4><a name = "tag_001_003_001">&nbsp;</a>Development</h4>
<xref type="3" name="dev"></xref>
Utilities marked <b>DEVELOPMENT</b> in this specification are:
<pre>
<center>
<table  bordercolor=#000000 border=1 align=center><tr valign=top><th colspan=4 align=center><b>Development Utilities</b>
<tr valign=top><td align=left>admin
<td align=left>get
<td align=left>nm
<td align=left>strip
<tr valign=top><td align=left>cflow

<td align=left>&nbsp;
<td align=left>&nbsp;
<td align=left>&nbsp;
</table>
</center>
</pre>
Even if the DEVELOPMENT option is supported, or the LEGACY option is
supported, the
<i>dis</i>
utility need not be supported.
<h4><a name = "tag_001_003_002">&nbsp;</a>FORTRAN</h4>
<xref type="3" name="fortran"></xref>
The
<i><a href="fort77.htm">fort77</a></i>
FORTRAN compiler is the only utility marked <b>FORTRAN</b> in this
specification.
<h4><a name = "tag_001_003_003">&nbsp;</a>LEGACY</h4>
<xref type="3" name="legacy"></xref>
The utilities in the table below are marked <b>LEGACY</b>.
Various factors may have contributed to the decision to class a
utility <b>LEGACY</b>.
Application writers should not use functionality marked <b>LEGACY</b>.
<p>
If a migration path exists, advice is given to application developers
regarding alternative means of obtaining similar functionality.
This information may be found in the APPLICATION USAGE
sections on the relevant pages.
<p>
No requirement beyond that which was in effect at the time
that these utilities were marked <b>LEGACY</b> shall be applied to
these utilities.
