<h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2448">&nbsp;</a>NAME</h4><blockquote>
umask - get or set the file mode creation mask
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2449">&nbsp;</a>SYNOPSIS</h4><blockquote>
<pre><code>

umask <b>[</b>-S<b>][</b><i>mask</i><b>]
</b></code>
</pre>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2450">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>umask</i>
utility will set the file mode creation mask of the
current shell execution environment (see
<xref href=shexenv><a href="chap2.htm#tag_001_012">
Shell Execution Environment
</a></xref>)
to the value specified by the
<i>mask</i>
operand.
This mask will affect the initial value of the file permission bits
of subsequently created files.
If
<i>umask</i>
is called in a subshell or separate utility execution environment,
such as one of the following:
<pre>
<code>
(umask 002)
nohup umask ...
find . -exec umask ... \;
</code>
</pre>
it will not affect the file mode creation mask of the caller's environment.
<p>
If the
<i>mask</i>
operand is not specified, the
<i>umask</i>
utility will write to standard output the value of the invoking
process's file mode creation mask.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2451">&nbsp;</a>OPTIONS</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>umask</i>
utility supports the <b>XBD</b> specification, <a href="../xbd/utilconv.htm#usg"><b>Utility Syntax Guidelines</b>&nbsp;</a> .
<p>
The following option is supported:
<dl compact>

<dt><b>-S</b>
<dd>Produce symbolic output.

</dl>
<p>
The default output style is unspecified, but will be recognised
on a subsequent invocation of
<i>umask</i>
on the same system as a
<i>mask</i>
operand to restore the previous file mode creation mask.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2452">&nbsp;</a>OPERANDS</h4><blockquote>
The following operand is supported:
<dl compact>

<dt><i>mask</i><dd>A string specifying the new file mode creation mask.
The string is treated in the same way as the
<i>mode</i>
operand described in the the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section
for
<i><a href="chmod.htm">chmod</a></i>.

For a
<i>symbolic_mode</i>
value,
the new value of the file mode creation mask
will be the logical complement of the file permission bits
portion of the file mode specified by the
<i>symbolic_mode</i>
string.

In a
<i>symbolic_mode</i>
value, the permissions
<i>op</i>
characters "+" and "-" will be interpreted relative to the
current file mode creation mask; "+"
will cause the bits for the indicated permissions to be cleared in the mask;
"-" will cause the bits for the indicated permissions to be set
in the mask.

The interpretation of
<i>mode</i>
values that specify file mode bits other than the
file permission bits is unspecified.

In the obsolescent octal integer form of
<i>mode</i>,
the specified bits will be set in the file mode creation mask.

The file mode creation mask will be set to the resulting numeric value.

The default output of a prior invocation of
<i>umask</i>
on the same system with no
operand will also be recognised as a
<i>mask</i>
operand.
The use of an operand obtained in this way is
not obsolescent, even if it is an octal number.

</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2453">&nbsp;</a>STDIN</h4><blockquote>
Not used.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2454">&nbsp;</a>INPUT FILES</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2455">&nbsp;</a>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h4><blockquote>
The following environment variables affect the execution of
<i>umask</i>:
<dl compact>

<dt><i>LANG</i><dd>Provide a default value for the internationalisation variables
that are unset or null.
If
<i>LANG</i>
is unset or null, the corresponding value from the
implementation-dependent default locale will be used.
If any of the internationalisation variables contains an invalid setting, the
utility will behave as if none of the variables had been defined.

<dt><i>LC_ALL</i><dd>
If set to a non-empty string value,
override the values of all the other internationalisation variables.

<dt><i>LC_CTYPE</i><dd>
Determine the
locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single- as opposed to multi-byte characters
in arguments).

<dt><i>LC_MESSAGES</i><dd>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect
the format and contents of diagnostic
messages written to standard error.

<dt><i>NLSPATH</i><dd>
Determine the location of message catalogues
for the processing of
<i>LC_MESSAGES .
</i>
</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2456">&nbsp;</a>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS</h4><blockquote>
Default.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2457">&nbsp;</a>STDOUT</h4><blockquote>
When the
<i>mask</i>
operand is not specified, the
<i>umask</i>
utility will write a message to standard output
that can later be used as a
<i>umask</i>
<i>mask</i>
operand.
<p>
If
<b>-S</b>
is specified, the message will be in the following format:
<p><code>
<pre>
<tt>"u=%s,g=%s,o=%s\n"</tt>, &lt;<i>owner permissions</i>&gt;,
&lt;<i>group permissions</i>&gt;,
&lt;<i>other permissions</i>&gt;
</pre>
</code>
where the three values will be combinations of letters from the set
{r,
w,
x};
the presence of a letter will indicate that the corresponding bit is clear
in the file mode creation mask.
<p>
If a
<i>mask</i>
operand is specified,
there will be no output written to standard output.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2458">&nbsp;</a>STDERR</h4><blockquote>
Used only for diagnostic messages.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2459">&nbsp;</a>OUTPUT FILES</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2460">&nbsp;</a>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2461">&nbsp;</a>EXIT STATUS</h4><blockquote>
The following exit values are returned:
<dl compact>

<dt>0<dd>The file mode creation mask was successfully changed, or no
<i>mask</i>
operand was supplied.

<dt>&gt;0<dd>An error occurred.

</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2462">&nbsp;</a>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS</h4><blockquote>
Default.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2463">&nbsp;</a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4><blockquote>
Since
<i>umask</i>
affects the current shell execution environment,
it is generally provided as a shell regular built-in.
<p>
In contrast to the negative permission logic provided by the
file mode creation mask and the octal number form of the
<i>mask</i>
argument,
the symbolic form of the
<i>mask</i>
argument specifies those permissions that are left alone.
<p>
The references to octal modes are supported
because, although they are obsolescent in the ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993 standard,
XSI-conformant systems have committed to maintaining them
for portable applications until further notice.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2464">&nbsp;</a>EXAMPLES</h4><blockquote>
Either of the commands:
<pre>
<code>
umask a=rx,ug+w

umask 002
</code>
</pre>
sets the mode mask so that subsequently created files have their
S_IWOTH
bit cleared.
<p>
After setting the mode mask with either of the above commands, the
<i>umask</i>
command can be used to write out the current value of the mode mask:
<pre>
<code>
<b>$ </b>umask
<b>0002
</b></code>
</pre>
<p>
(The output format is
unspecified, but historical implementations use the obsolescent octal
integer mode format.)
<pre>
<code>
<b>$ </b>umask -S
<b>u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rx
</b></code>
</pre>
<p>
Either of these outputs can be used as the mask operand
to a subsequent invocation of the
<i>umask</i>
utility.
<p>
Assuming the mode mask is set as above, the command:
<pre>
<code>
umask g-w
</code>
</pre>
sets the mode mask so that subsequently created files have their
S_IWGRP,
and
S_IWOTH
bits cleared.
<p>
The command:
<pre>
<code>
umask -- -w
</code>
</pre>
<p>
sets the mode mask so that subsequently created files have all their write
bits cleared.
Note that
<i>mask</i>
operands
<b>-r</b>,
<b>-w</b>,
<b>-x</b>
or anything beginning
with a hyphen, must be preceded by
--
to keep it from being interpreted as an option.
