<h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2600">&nbsp;</a>NAME</h4><blockquote>
unpack - expand files (<b><a href="intro.htm#tag_001_003_003">LEGACY</a></b>)
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2601">&nbsp;</a>SYNOPSIS</h4><blockquote>
<pre><code>

unpack <i>file</i>...
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2602">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>unpack</i>
utility replaces files in the format used by
<i><a href="pack.htm">pack</a></i>
with their unpacked form.
For each file
<i>file</i>
operand, a search is made for a file called
<i>file</i><b>.z</b>
(or just
<i>file</i>,
if
<i>file</i>
ends in
.z).
If this file appears to be a packed file, it is replaced by
its expanded version.
The new file has the
.z
stripped from its name. If the invoking process has appropriate privileges,
the ownership, modes, access time, and modification time of the original file
are preserved.
<p>
A file is not unpacked if one of the following is true:
<ul>
<p>
<li>
The filename (exclusive of the
<b>.z</b>)
has more than
{NAME_MAX}
bytes.
<p>
<li>
The file cannot be opened.
<p>
<li>
The file does not appear to be the output of
<i><a href="pack.htm">pack</a></i>.
<p>
<li>
A file with the unpacked name already exists.
<p>
<li>
The unpacked file cannot be created.
<p>
</ul>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2603">&nbsp;</a>OPTIONS</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2604">&nbsp;</a>OPERANDS</h4><blockquote>
The following operand is supported:
<dl compact>

<dt><i>file</i><dd>A pathname of a file to be unpacked;
<i>file</i>
can include or omit the
.z
suffix.

</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2605">&nbsp;</a>STDIN</h4><blockquote>
Not used.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2606">&nbsp;</a>INPUT FILES</h4><blockquote>
The input files are regular files in the format created by
<i><a href="pack.htm">pack</a></i>.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2607">&nbsp;</a>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h4><blockquote>
The following environment variables may affect the execution of
<i><a href="pack.htm">pack</a></i>:
<dl compact>

<dt><i>LANG</i><dd>Provide a default value for the internationalisation variables
that are unset or null.
If
<i>LANG</i>
is unset or null, the corresponding value from the
implementation-dependent default locale will be used.
If any of the internationalisation variables contains an invalid setting, the
utility will behave as if none of the variables had been defined.

<dt><i>LC_ALL</i><dd>
If set to a non-empty string value,
override the values of all the other internationalisation variables.

<dt><i>LC_CTYPE</i><dd>
Determine the
locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single- as opposed to multi-byte characters
in arguments).

<dt><i>LC_MESSAGES</i><dd>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect
the format and contents of diagnostic
messages written to standard error,
and informative messages written to standard output.

<dt><i>NLSPATH</i><dd>
Determine the location of message catalogues
for the processing of
<i>LC_MESSAGES .
</i>
</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2608">&nbsp;</a>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS</h4><blockquote>
If an error occurs, the
$(basename file .z)
file is not created and the original file is unchanged.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2609">&nbsp;</a>STDOUT</h4><blockquote>
The standard output is a text file containing one line for
each file unpacked, with the following format
in the POSIX locale:
<p><code>
<tt>"unpack: %s: unpacked\n"</tt>, <i>file</i>
</code>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2610">&nbsp;</a>STDERR</h4><blockquote>
Used only for diagnostic messages.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2611">&nbsp;</a>OUTPUT FILES</h4><blockquote>
Files equivalent to the original unpacked file are created
with the names as though
$(basename file .z).
