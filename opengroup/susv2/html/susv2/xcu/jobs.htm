<h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1023">&nbsp;</a>NAME</h4><blockquote>
jobs - display status of jobs in the current session
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1024">&nbsp;</a>SYNOPSIS</h4><blockquote>
<pre><code>

jobs <b>[</b> -l| -p<b>][</b><i>job_id</i>...<b>]</b>
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1025">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>jobs</i>
utility displays the status of jobs
that were started in the current shell environment; see
<xref href=shexenv><a href="chap2.htm#tag_001_012">
Shell Execution Environment
</a></xref>.
<p>
When
<i>jobs</i>
reports the termination status of a job,
the shell removes its process ID
from the list of those &quot;known in the current shell execution environment&quot;;
see
<xref href=asyncl><a href="chap2.htm#tag_001_009_003">
Lists
</a></xref>.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1026">&nbsp;</a>OPTIONS</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>jobs</i>
utility supports the <b>XBD</b> specification, <a href="../xbd/utilconv.htm#usg"><b>Utility Syntax Guidelines</b>&nbsp;</a> .
<p>
The following options are supported:
<dl compact>

<dt><b>-l</b>
<dd>(The letter ell.)
Provide more information about each job listed.
This information includes the
job number, current job, process group ID, state
and the command that formed the job.

<dt><b>-p</b>
<dd>Display only the process IDs for the process group leaders
of the selected jobs.

</dl>
<p>
By default, the
<i>jobs</i>
utility displays the status of all stopped jobs,
running background jobs and all jobs whose status has
changed and have not been reported by the shell.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1027">&nbsp;</a>OPERANDS</h4><blockquote>
The following operand is supported:
<dl compact>

<dt><i>job_id</i><dd>Specifies the jobs for which the status is to be displayed.
If no
<i>job_id</i>
is given, the status information for all jobs will be displayed.
The format of
<i>job_id</i>
is described in the entry for
<b>job control job ID</b>
in
the <b>XBD</b> specification, <a href="../xbd/glossary.htm"><b>Glossary</b>&nbsp;</a> .

</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1028">&nbsp;</a>STDIN</h4><blockquote>
Not used.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1029">&nbsp;</a>INPUT FILES</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1030">&nbsp;</a>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h4><blockquote>
The following environment variables affect the execution of
<i>jobs</i>:
<dl compact>

<dt><i>LANG</i><dd>Provide a default value for the internationalisation variables
that are unset or null.
If
<i>LANG</i>
is unset or null, the corresponding value from the
implementation-dependent default locale will be used.
If any of the internationalisation variables contains an invalid setting, the
utility will behave as if none of the variables had been defined.

<dt><i>LC_ALL</i><dd>
If set to a non-empty string value,
override the values of all the other internationalisation variables.

<dt><i>LC_CTYPE</i><dd>
Determine the
locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single- as opposed to multi-byte characters
in arguments).

<dt><i>LC_MESSAGES</i><dd>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect
the format and contents of diagnostic
messages written to standard error
and informative messages written to standard output.

<dt><i>NLSPATH</i><dd>
Determine the location of message catalogues
for the processing of
<i>LC_MESSAGES .
</i>
</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1031">&nbsp;</a>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS</h4><blockquote>
Default.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1032">&nbsp;</a>STDOUT</h4><blockquote>
If the
<b>-p</b>
option is specified, the output consists of one line for each
process ID:
<p><code>
<tt>"%d\n"</tt>, &lt;<i>process ID</i>&gt;
</code>
<p>
Otherwise, if the
<b>-l</b>
option is not specified, the output is a series of lines of the form:
<p><code>
<pre>
<tt>"[%d] %c %s %s\n"</tt>, &lt;<i>job-number</i>&gt;,
&lt;<i>current</i>&gt;,
&lt;<i>state</i>&gt;,
&lt;<i>command</i>&gt;
</code>
</pre>
where the fields are as follows:
<dl compact>

<dt><b>&lt;</b><i>current</i><b>&gt;</b><dd>
The character "+"
identifies the job that would be used as a default for the
<i><a href="fg.htm">fg</a></i>
or
<i><a href="bg.htm">bg</a></i>
utilities; this job can also be specified using the
<i>job_id</i>
<b>%+</b>
or
<b>%%</b>.
The character "-" identifies the job that would become the default
if the current default job were to exit;
this job can also be specified using the
<i>job_id</i>
<b>%-</b>.
For other jobs, this field is a
space character.
At most one job can be identified with "+" and at most one job
can be identified with "-".
If there is any suspended job, then the current job
will be a suspended job.
If there are at least two suspended jobs,
then the previous job will also be a suspended job.

<dt><b>&lt;</b><i>job-number</i><b>&gt;</b><dd>
A number that can be used to identify the process group to the
<i><a href="wait.htm">wait</a></i>,
<i><a href="fg.htm">fg</a></i>,
<i><a href="bg.htm">bg</a></i>
and
<i><a href="kill.htm">kill</a></i>
utilities.
Using these utilities, the job can be identified
by prefixing the job number with "%".

<dt><b>&lt;</b><i>state</i><b>&gt;</b><dd>One of the following strings (in the POSIX locale):
<dl compact>

<dt><b>Running</b><dd>
Indicates that the job has not been suspended
by a signal and has not exited.

<dt><b>Done</b><dd>Indicates that the job completed and returned exit status zero.

<dt><b>Done(</b><i>code</i><b>)</b><dd>
Indicates that the job completed normally and
that it exited with the specified non-zero exit status,
<i>code</i>,
expressed as a decimal number.

<dt><b>Stopped</b><br>
<b>Stopped (SIGTSTP)</b><dd>
Indicates that the job was suspended by the SIGTSTP signal.

<dt><b>Stopped (SIGSTOP)</b><dd>
Indicates that the job was suspended by the SIGSTOP signal.

<dt><b>Stopped (SIGTTIN)</b><dd>
Indicates that the job was suspended by the SIGTTIN signal.

<dt><b>Stopped (SIGTTOU)</b><dd>
Indicates that the job was suspended by the SIGTTOU signal.

</dl>
<p>
The implementation may substitute the string
<b>Suspended</b>
in place of
<b>Stopped</b>.
If the job was terminated by a signal, the format of
&lt;<i>state</i>&gt;
is unspecified, but it will be visibly distinct
from all of the other
&lt;<i>state</i>&gt;
formats shown here and will indicate the name or description
of the signal causing the termination.
<p>
<dt><b>&lt;</b><i>command</i><b>&gt;</b><dd>
The associated command that was given to the shell.
<p>
</dl>
<p>
If the
<b>-l</b>
option is specified, a field containing
the process group ID
is inserted before the
&lt;<i>state</i>&gt;
field.
Also, more processes in a process group may be output
on separate lines, using only the process ID and
&lt;<i>command</i>&gt;
fields.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1033">&nbsp;</a>STDERR</h4><blockquote>
Used only for diagnostic messages.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1034">&nbsp;</a>OUTPUT FILES</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1035">&nbsp;</a>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1036">&nbsp;</a>EXIT STATUS</h4><blockquote>
The following exit values are returned:
<dl compact>

<dt>0<dd>Successful completion.

<dt>&gt;0<dd>An error occurred.

</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1037">&nbsp;</a>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS</h4><blockquote>
Default.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_1038">&nbsp;</a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4><blockquote>
The
<b>-p</b>
option
is the only portable way to find out the process group of a job
because different implementations have
different strategies for defining the process group of the job.
Usage such as
$(jobs&nbsp;-p)
provides a way
of referring to the process group of the job in an
implementation-independent way.
<p>
The
<i>jobs</i>
utility will not work as expected when it
is operating in its own utility execution environment
because that environment will have no applicable jobs
to manipulate.
See the APPLICATION USAGE section for
<i><a href="bg.htm">bg</a></i>.
For this reason,
<i>jobs</i>
is generally implemented as a shell regular built-in.

None.
