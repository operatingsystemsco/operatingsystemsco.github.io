<h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2638">&nbsp;</a>NAME</h4><blockquote>
uudecode - decode a binary file
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2639">&nbsp;</a>SYNOPSIS</h4><blockquote>
<pre><code>

uudecode <b>[</b><i>file</i><b>]</b>
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2640">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>uudecode</i>
utility reads a file or standard input if no file is specified,
that includes data created by the
<i><a href="uuencode.htm">uuencode</a></i>
utility.
The
<i>uudecode</i>
utility scans the input file, searching for
data compatible with the format specified in
<i><a href="uuencode.htm">uuencode</a></i>
and attempts to create or overwrite the
file described by the data.
The pathname, file access permission bits
and contents for the file to be produced
are all contained in that data.
The mode bits of the created file will be set from the file access
permission bits contained in the data; that is,
other attributes of the mode,
including the file mode creation mask (see
<i><a href="umask.htm">umask</a></i>),
will not affect the file being produced.
<p>
If the pathname of the file to be produced exists, and the user
does not have write permission on that file,
<i>uudecode</i>
will terminate with an error.
If the pathname of the file to be produced exists,
and the user has write permission on that file, the existing file
will be overwritten.
<p>
If the input data was produced by
<i><a href="uuencode.htm">uuencode</a></i>
on a system with a different number of bits per byte
than on the target system, the results of
<i>uudecode</i>
are unspecified.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2641">&nbsp;</a>OPTIONS</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2642">&nbsp;</a>OPERANDS</h4><blockquote>
The following operand is supported:
<dl compact>

<dt><i>file</i><dd>The pathname of a file containing the output of
<i><a href="uuencode.htm">uuencode</a></i>.

</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2643">&nbsp;</a>STDIN</h4><blockquote>
See the INPUT FILES section.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2644">&nbsp;</a>INPUT FILES</h4><blockquote>
The input files must be files containing the output of
<i><a href="uuencode.htm">uuencode</a></i>.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2645">&nbsp;</a>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h4><blockquote>
The following environment variables affect the execution of
<i>uudecode</i>:
<dl compact>

<dt><i>LANG</i><dd>Provide a default value for the internationalisation variables
that are unset or null.
If
<i>LANG</i>
is unset or null, the corresponding value from the
implementation-dependent default locale will be used.
If any of the internationalisation variables contains an invalid setting, the
utility will behave as if none of the variables had been defined.

<dt><i>LC_ALL</i><dd>
If set to a non-empty string value,
override the values of all the other internationalisation variables.

<dt><i>LC_CTYPE</i><dd>
Determine the
locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single- as opposed to multi-byte characters
in arguments and input files).

<dt><i>LC_MESSAGES</i><dd>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect
the format and contents of diagnostic
messages written to standard error.

<dt><i>NLSPATH</i><dd>
Determine the location of message catalogues
for the processing of
<i>LC_MESSAGES .
</i>
</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2646">&nbsp;</a>ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS</h4><blockquote>
Default.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2647">&nbsp;</a>STDOUT</h4><blockquote>
Not used.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2648">&nbsp;</a>STDERR</h4><blockquote>
Used only for diagnostic messages.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2649">&nbsp;</a>OUTPUT FILES</h4><blockquote>
The output file will be in the same format as the file originally encoded by
<i><a href="uuencode.htm">uuencode</a></i>.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2650">&nbsp;</a>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2651">&nbsp;</a>EXIT STATUS</h4><blockquote>
The following exit values are returned:
<dl compact>

<dt>0<dd>Successful completion.

<dt>&gt;0<dd>An error occurred.

</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2652">&nbsp;</a>CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS</h4><blockquote>
Default.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2653">&nbsp;</a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4><blockquote>
The user who is invoking
<i>uudecode</i>
must have write permission on any file being created.
<p>
The output of
<i><a href="uuencode.htm">uuencode</a></i>
is essentially an encoded bit stream
that is not cognizant of byte boundaries.
It is possible that a 9-bit byte target
machine can process input from an 8-bit
source, if it is aware of the requirement,
but the reverse is unlikely to be satisfying.
Of course, the only data that is meaningful
for such a transfer between architectures is generally
character data.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2654">&nbsp;</a>EXAMPLES</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2655">&nbsp;</a>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_001_014_2656">&nbsp;</a>SEE ALSO</h4><blockquote>
