</center>
Applications should ensure that the feature test macro _XOPEN_SOURCE
is defined with the value 500 before inclusion of any header.
This is needed to enable the
functionality described in this document,
and possibly to enable functionality defined elsewhere in the Common
Applications Environment.
<p>
The _XOPEN_SOURCE macro may be defined automatically by the
compilation process, but to ensure maximum portability, applications
should make sure that _XOPEN_SOURCE is defined by using either
compiler options or
<b>#define</b>
directives in the source files, before any
<b>#include</b>
directives.  Identifiers in this document may be undefined using the
<b>#undef</b>
directive as described in
<a href="namespac.htm">The Name Space</a>.
These
<b>#undef</b>
directives must follow all
<b>#include</b>
directives of any XSI headers.
<p>
Since this specification is aligned with the ISO&nbsp;C standard,
and since all functionality enabled by _POSIX_C_SOURCE set 
greater than zero and less than or equal to 199506L
should be enabled by _XOPEN_SOURCE set equal to 500,
there should be no need to
define either _POSIX_SOURCE or _POSIX_C_SOURCE if _XOPEN_SOURCE is
defined.  
Therefore if _XOPEN_SOURCE is set equal to 500 and _POSIX_SOURCE is
defined, or _POSIX_C_SOURCE is set greater than zero and less than
or equal to 199506L, the behavior is the
same as if only _XOPEN_SOURCE is defined and set equal to 500.
However, should _POSIX_C_SOURCE be set to a value greater than 199506L,
the behaviour is undefined.
<p>
The
<i><a href="../xcu/c89.htm">c89</a></i>
and
<i><a href="../xcu/cc.htm">cc</a></i>
utilities recognise the additional
<b>-l</b>
operand for standard libraries:
<dl compact>

<dt><b>-l&nbsp;xnet</b><dd>If the implementation defines _XOPEN_UNIX, this operand makes visible
all functions referenced in this document.  An implementation may search this
library in the absence of this operand.

</dl>
<p>
It is unspecified whether the library
<b>libxnet.a</b>
exists as a regular file.
<p>
If the implementation supports the utilities marked
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
in the <b>XCU</b> specification, the
<i><a href="../xcu/lint.htm">lint</a></i>
utility recognises the additional
<b>-l</b>
operand for standard libraries:
<dl compact>

<dt><b>-l&nbsp;xnet</b><dd>Names the library
<b>llib-lxnet.ln</b>,
which will contain functions specified in this document.

</dl>
<p>
It is unspecified whether the library
<b>llib-lxnet.ln</b>
exists as a regular file.
