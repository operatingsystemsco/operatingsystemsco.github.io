<h4>NAME</h4><blockquote>
sendmsg - send a message on a socket using a message structure
</blockquote><h4>SYNOPSIS</h4><blockquote>
<pre><code>

#include &lt;<a href="sysso38.htm">sys/socket.h</a>&gt;

ssize_t sendmsg (int <I>socket</I>, const struct msghdr *<I>message</I>, int <I>flags</I>);
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote><h4>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>sendmsg()</i>
function sends a message through a connection-mode or connectionless-mode
socket.  If the socket is connectionless-mode, the message will be sent to the
address specified by <I>msghdr</I>.  If the socket is connection-mode, the
destination address in <I>msghdr</I> is ignored.
<p>
The function takes the following arguments:
<dl compact>

<dt><I>socket</I><dd>Specifies the socket file descriptor.

<dt><I>message</I><dd>Points to a <B>msghdr</B> structure, containing both the destination
address and the buffers for the outgoing message.
The length and format of the address depend on the address
family of the socket.  The <B>msg_flags</B> member is ignored.

<dt><I>flags</I><dd>Specifies the type of message transmission.
The application may specify 0 or the following flag:
<dl compact>

<dt>MSG_EOR<dd>Terminates a record (if supported by the protocol)

<dt>MSG_OOB<dd>Sends out-of-band data on sockets that support out-of-bound data.
The significance and semantics of out-of-band data are protocol-specific.

</dl>
<p>
</dl>
<p>
The 
<I>msg_iov</I>
and 
<I>msg_iovlen</I>
fields of message specify
zero or more buffers containing the data to be sent.
<I>msg_iov</I>
points to an array of 
<B>iovec</B>
structures; 
<I>msg_iovlen</I>
must be set to the dimension of this array.
In each 
<B>iovec</B>
structure, the 
<I>iov_base</I>
field specifies 
a storage area and the 
<I>iov_len</I>
field gives its size 
in bytes. Some of these sizes can be zero. The data
from each storage area indicated by 
<I>msg_iov</I>
is sent in turn.
<p>
Successful completion of a call to
<i>sendmsg()</i>
does not guarantee delivery of the message.
A return value of -1 indicates only locally-detected errors.
<p>
If space is not available at the sending socket to hold the message to be
transmitted and the socket file descriptor does not have O_NONBLOCK set,
<i>sendmsg()</i>
function blocks until space is available.  If space is not available at the
sending socket to hold the message to be transmitted and the socket file
descriptor does have O_NONBLOCK set,
<i>sendmsg()</i>
function will fail.
<p>
If the socket protocol supports broadcast and the specified address
is a broadcast address for the socket protocol,
<i>sendmsg()</i>
will fail if the SO_BROADCAST option is not set for the socket.
<p>
The socket in use may require the process to have appropriate
privileges to use the
<i>sendmsg()</i>
function.
</blockquote><h4>RETURN VALUE</h4><blockquote>
Upon successful completion,
<i>sendmsg()</i>
function returns the number of bytes sent.  Otherwise, -1
is returned and <I>errno</I> is set to indicate the error.
</blockquote><h4>ERRORS</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>sendmsg()</i>
function will fail if:
<dl compact>

<dt>[EAGAIN] or [EWOULDBLOCK]<dd><br>
The socket's file descriptor is marked O_NONBLOCK and the requested operation
would block.

<dt>[EAFNOSUPPORT]<dd>Addresses in the specified address family cannot be used with this socket.

<dt>[EBADF]<dd>The <I>socket</I> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

<dt>[ECONNRESET]<dd>A connection was forcibly closed by a peer.

<dt>[EFAULT]<dd>The 
<I>message</I>
parameter, or storage pointed to by the 
<I>msg_name</I>,
<I>msg_control</I>
or 
<I>msg_iov</I>
fields of the 
<I>message</I>
parameter, or storage pointed to by the
<B>iovec</B>
structures pointed to by the 
<I>msg_iov</I>
field can not be accessed.

<dt>[EINTR]<dd>A signal interrupted
<i>sendmsg()</i>
before any data was transmitted.

<dt>[EINVAL]<dd>The sum of the <B>iov_len</B> values overflows an <B>ssize_t</B>.

<dt>[EMSGSIZE]<dd>The message is to large to be sent all at once (as the socket
requires), or the
<B>msg_iovlen</B>
member of the
<B>msghdr</B>
structure pointed to by
<I>message</I>
is less than or equal to 0 or is greater than {IOV_MAX}.

<dt>[ENOTCONN]<dd>The socket is connection-mode but is not connected.

<dt>[ENOTSOCK]<dd>The <I>socket</I> argument does not refer a socket.

<dt>[EOPNOTSUPP]<dd>The <I>socket</I> argument is associated with a socket that does not
support one or more of the values set in <I>flags</I>.

<dt>[EPIPE]<dd>The socket is shut down for writing, or the socket is
connection-mode and is no longer connected.
In the latter case, and if the socket is of type SOCK_STREAM, the SIGPIPE
signal is generated to the calling process.

</dl>
<p>
If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX, then
<i>sendmsg()</i>
will fail if:
<dl compact>

<dt>[EIO]<dd>An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.

<dt>[ELOOP]<dd>Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname in the
socket address.

<dt>[ENAMETOOLONG]<dd>A component of a pathname exceeded {NAME_MAX} characters, or an entire
pathname exceeded {PATH_MAX} characters.

<dt>[ENOENT]<dd>A component of the pathname does not name an existing file or the pathname is
an empty string.

<dt>[ENOTDIR]<dd>A component of the path prefix of the pathname in the socket address is not a
directory.

</dl>
<p>
The
<i>sendmsg()</i>
function may fail if:
<dl compact>

<dt>[EACCES]<dd>Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix;
or write access to the named socket is denied.

<dt>[EDESTADDRREQ]<dd>The socket is not connection-mode and does not have its peer address set,
and no destination address was specified.

<dt>[EHOSTUNREACH]<dd>The destination host cannot be reached (probably because the host is down or
a remote router cannot reach it).

<dt>[EIO]<dd>An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.

<dt>[EISCONN]<dd>A destination address was specified and the socket
is already connected.

<dt>[ENETDOWN]<dd>The local interface used to reach the destination is down.

<dt>[ENETUNREACH]<dd>No route to the network is present.

<dt>[ENOBUFS]<dd>Insufficient resources were available in the system to perform the operation.

<dt>[ENOMEM]<dd>Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the request.

<dt>[ENOSR]<dd>There were insufficient STREAMS resources available for the operation to
complete.

</dl>
<br>
<p>
If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX, then
<i>sendmsg()</i>
may fail if:
<dl compact>

<dt>[ENAMETOOLONG]<dd>Pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate result whose
length exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

</dl>
