<P>
The Open Group is a not-for-profit company with over 15 years experience
of developing standards and interoperable products.
<P>
<em>Why are standards important?</em>
<P>

Standards allow applications to be developed independent of any
particular operating system implementation. They allow a stable
foundation on which application development can occur and 
application investment can be preserved. The UNIX specification
is one such application platform.
<P>
The Open Group has been the custodian of the specification for the UNIX 
system and the trademark since 1993. The effort that led to this
transfer was the catalyst for all vendors to make their systems
conform to this single definition, a goal that had been
elusive in previous harmonization efforts. Today all the major
vendors support the Single UNIX Specification and have registered
product.
