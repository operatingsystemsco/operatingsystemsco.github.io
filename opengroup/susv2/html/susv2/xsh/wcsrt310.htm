<h4><a name = "tag_000_010_590">&nbsp;</a>NAME</h4><blockquote>
wcsrtombs - convert a wide-character string to a character string
(restartable)
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_010_591">&nbsp;</a>SYNOPSIS</h4><blockquote>
<pre><code>

#include &lt;<a href="wchar309.htm">wchar.h</a>&gt;

size_t wcsrtombs(char *<i>dst</i>, const wchar_t **<i>src</i>, size_t <i>len</i>, 
    mbstate_t *<i>ps</i>);
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_010_592">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>wcsrtombs()</i>
function converts a sequence of wide-characters from the array
indirectly pointed to by
<i>src</i>
into a sequence of corresponding characters, beginning in
the conversion state described by the object pointed to by
<i>ps</i>.
If
<i>dst</i>
is not a null pointer, the converted characters are then stored into
the array pointed to by
<i>dst</i>.
Conversion continues up to and including a terminating null 
wide-character, which is also stored.  Conversion stops earlier in the
following cases:
<ul>
<p>
<li>
When a code is reached that does not correspond to a valid 
character.
<p>
<li>
When the next character would exceed the limit of
<i>len</i>
total bytes to be stored in the array pointed to by
<i>dst</i>
(and
<i>dst</i>
is not a null pointer).
<p>
</ul>
<p>
Each conversion takes place as if by a call to the
<i><a href="wcrtomb.htm">wcrtomb()</a></i>
function.
<p>
If
<i>dst</i>
is not a null pointer, the pointer object pointed to by
<i>src</i>
is assigned either a null pointer (if conversion stopped due to
reaching a terminating null wide-character) or the address just 
past the last wide-character converted (if any).  If conversion
stopped due to reaching a terminating null wide-character, the
resulting state described is the initial conversion state.
<p>
If
<i>ps</i>
is a null pointer, the
<i>wcsrtombs()</i>
function uses its own internal
<b>mbstate_t</b>
object, which is initialised at program startup to the initial
conversion state.  Otherwise, the 
<b>mbstate_t</b>
object pointed to by
<i>ps</i>
is used to completely describe the current conversion state of the
associated character sequence.
The implementation will behave as if no function defined in this
specification calls
<i>wcsrtombs()</i>.
<p>
The behaviour of this function is affected by the LC_CTYPE category of
the current locale.  
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_010_593">&nbsp;</a>RETURN VALUE</h4><blockquote>
If conversion stops because a code is reached that does not correspond
to a valid character, an encoding error occurs.  In this
case, the
<i>wcsrtombs()</i>
function stores the value of the macro EILSEQ in
<i>errno</i>
and returns
<b>(size_t)-1</b>;
the conversion state is undefined.  Otherwise, it returns the number
of bytes in the resulting character sequence, not
including the terminating null (if any).
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_010_594">&nbsp;</a>ERRORS</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>wcsrtombs()</i>
function may fail if:
<dl compact>

<dt>[EINVAL]<dd>
<i>ps</i>
points to an object that contains an invalid conversion state.

<dt>[EILSEQ]<dd>
A wide-character code does not correspond to a valid character.

</dl>
