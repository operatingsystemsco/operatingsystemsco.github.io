<h4><a name = "tag_000_010_626">&nbsp;</a>NAME</h4><blockquote>
wcstok - split wide-character string into tokens
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_010_627">&nbsp;</a>SYNOPSIS</h4><blockquote>
<pre><code>

#include &lt;<a href="wchar309.htm">wchar.h</a>&gt;

wchar_t *wcstok(wchar_t *<i>ws1</i>, const wchar_t *<i>ws2</i>, wchar_t **ptr);
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_010_628">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
A sequence of calls to
<i>wcstok()</i>
breaks the wide-character string pointed to by
<i>ws1</i>
into a sequence of tokens, each of which is delimited by a
wide-character code from the wide-character string pointed to by
<i>ws2</i>.
The third argument points to a caller-provided 
<b>wchar_t</b>
pointer into which the
<i>wcstok()</i>
function stores information necessary for it to continue scanning the
same wide-character string.
<p>
The first call in the sequence has
<i>ws1</i>
as its first argument, and is followed by calls with a null
pointer as their first argument.
The separator string pointed to by
<i>ws2</i>
may be different from call to call.
<p>
The first call in the sequence searches the wide-character string pointed to by
<i>ws1</i>
for the first wide-character code that is
<i>not</i>
contained in the current separator string pointed to by
<i>ws2</i>.
If no such wide-character code is found, then there are no tokens in the
wide-character string pointed to by
<i>ws1</i>
and
<i>wcstok()</i>
returns a null pointer.  If such a wide-character code is found, it is the
start of the first token.
<p>
The
<i>wcstok()</i>
function then searches from there for a wide-character code that
<i>is</i>
contained in the current separator string.
If no such wide-character code is found, the current token
extends to the end of the wide-character string pointed to by
<i>ws1</i>,
and subsequent searches for a token will return a null pointer.
If such a wide-character code is found, it is overwritten by a null 
wide-character, which terminates the current token.
The
<i>wcstok()</i>
function saves a pointer to the following wide-character code, from which the
next search for a token will start.
<p>
Each subsequent call, with a null pointer as the value of the
first argument, starts searching from the saved pointer and
behaves as described above.
<p>
The implementation will behave as if no function calls
<i>wcstok()</i>.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_010_629">&nbsp;</a>RETURN VALUE</h4><blockquote>
Upon successful completion, the
<i>wcstok()</i>
function returns a pointer to the first wide-character code of a token.
Otherwise, if there is no token,
<i>wcstok()</i>
returns a null pointer.
