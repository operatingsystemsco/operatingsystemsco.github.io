<h4><a name = "tag_000_003_118">&nbsp;</a>NAME</h4><blockquote>
dlclose - close a dlopen() object
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_003_119">&nbsp;</a>SYNOPSIS</h4><blockquote>
<pre><code>

#include &lt;<a href="dlfcn40.htm">dlfcn.h</a>&gt;

int dlclose(void <i>*handle</i>);
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_003_120">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
<i>dlclose()</i>
is used to inform the system that the object referenced by a
<i>handle</i>
returned from a previous
<i><a href="dlopen.htm">dlopen()</a></i>
invocation is no longer needed by the application. 
<p>
The use of
<i>dlclose()</i>
reflects a statement of intent on the part of the process, but does not 
create any requirement upon the implementation, such as removal of the code or 
symbols referenced by
<i>handle</i>.
Once an object has been closed using
<i>dlclose()</i>
an application should assume that
its symbols are no longer available to
<i><a href="dlsym.htm">dlsym()</a></i>.
All objects loaded automatically as a result of invoking
<i><a href="dlopen.htm">dlopen()</a></i>
on the referenced object are also closed.
<p>
Although a
<i>dlclose()</i>
operation is not required to remove structures from an address space, neither
is an implementation prohibited from doing so. The only restriction on such a
removal is that no object will be removed to which references have been
relocated, until or unless all such references are removed. For instance,
an object that had been loaded with a
<i><a href="dlopen.htm">dlopen()</a></i>
operation specifying the RTLD_GLOBAL
flag might provide a target for dynamic relocations performed in the
processing of other objects - in such environments, an application may assume
that no relocation, once made, will be undone or remade unless the object
requiring the relocation has itself been removed.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_003_121">&nbsp;</a>RETURN VALUE</h4><blockquote>
If the referenced object was successfully closed,
<i>dlclose()</i>
returns 0. If the object could not be closed, or if
<i>handle</i>
does not refer to an open object, 
<i>dlclose()</i>
returns a non-zero value. More detailed diagnostic information will be
available through
<i><a href="dlerror.htm">dlerror()</a></i>.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_003_122">&nbsp;</a>ERRORS</h4><blockquote>
No errors are defined.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_003_123">&nbsp;</a>EXAMPLES</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_003_124">&nbsp;</a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4><blockquote>
A portable application will employ a
<i>handle</i>
returned from a 
<i><a href="dlopen.htm">dlopen()</a></i>
invocation only within a given scope bracketed by the
<i><a href="dlopen.htm">dlopen()</a></i>
and
<i>dlclose()</i>
operations. Implementations are free to use reference counting or other
techniques such that multiple calls to 
<i><a href="dlopen.htm">dlopen()</a></i>
referencing the same object may return the same object for
<i>handle</i>.
Implementations are also free to re-use a
<i>handle</i>.
For these reasons, the value of a
<i>handle</i>
must be treated as an opaque object by the application, used only in calls
to 
<i><a href="dlsym.htm">dlsym()</a></i>
and
<i>dlclose()</i>.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_003_125">&nbsp;</a>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_003_126">&nbsp;</a>SEE ALSO</h4><blockquote>
<i><a href="dlerror.htm">dlerror()</a></i>,
<i><a href="dlopen.htm">dlopen()</a></i>,
<i><a href="dlsym.htm">dlsym()</a></i>.
