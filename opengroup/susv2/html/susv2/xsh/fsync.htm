<h4><a name = "tag_000_005_320">&nbsp;</a>NAME</h4><blockquote>
fsync - synchronise changes to a file
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_321">&nbsp;</a>SYNOPSIS</h4><blockquote>
<pre><code>

#include &lt;<a href="unist299.htm">unistd.h</a>&gt;

int fsync(int <i>fildes</i>);
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_322">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>fsync()</i>
function can be used by an application to indicate that all
data for the open file description named by
<i>fildes</i>
is to be transferred to the storage device associated with
the file described by
<i>fildes</i>
in an implementation-dependent manner.
The
<i>fsync()</i>
function does not return until the system has completed that action
or until an error is detected.
<p>
The
<i>fsync()</i>
function forces all currently queued I/O operations associated with 
the file indicated by file descriptor
<i>fildes</i>
to the synchronised I/O completion state.
All I/O operations are completed as defined for
synchronised I/O file integrity completion.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_323">&nbsp;</a>RETURN VALUE</h4><blockquote>
Upon successful completion,
<i>fsync()</i>
returns 0.  Otherwise, -1 is returned and
<i>errno</i>
is set to indicate the error.
If the
<i>fsync()</i>
function fails,
outstanding I/O operations are not guaranteed to have been completed.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_324">&nbsp;</a>ERRORS</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>fsync()</i>
function will fail if:
<dl compact>

<dt>[EBADF]<dd>
The
<i>fildes</i>
argument is not a valid descriptor.

<dt>[EINTR]<dd>
The
<i>fsync()</i>
function was interrupted by a signal.

<dt>[EINVAL]<dd>
The
<i>fildes</i>
argument does not refer to a file on which this operation
is possible.

<dt>[EIO]<dd>
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.

</dl>
<p>
In the event that any of the queued I/O operations fail,
<i>fsync()</i>
returns the error conditions defined for
<i><a href="read.htm">read()</a></i>
and
<i><a href="write.htm">write()</a></i>.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_325">&nbsp;</a>EXAMPLES</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_326">&nbsp;</a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>fsync()</i>
function
should be used by programs which require modifications to a file
to be completed before continuing; for example, a program which contains
a simple transaction facility might use it to ensure that all
modifications to a file or files caused by a transaction are
recorded.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_327">&nbsp;</a>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_328">&nbsp;</a>SEE ALSO</h4><blockquote>
