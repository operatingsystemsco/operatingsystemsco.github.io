<h3><a name = "tag_000_004">&nbsp;</a>Error Numbers</h3>
</center>
<xref type="2" name="error"></xref>
Most functions can provide an error number.  The means by which each
function provides its error numbers is specified in its description.
<p>
Some functions provide the error number in a variable accessed through
the symbol <i>errno</i>.  The symbol <i>errno</i>, defined by including
the header
<i><a href="errno42.htm">&lt;errno.h&gt;</a></i>,
is a macro that expands to a modifiable lvalue of type <b>int</b>.
<p>
The value of <i>errno</i> should only be examined when it is indicated to be
valid by a function's return value.  No function in this specification sets
<i>errno</i> to zero to indicate an error.  For each thread of a process, the
value of <i>errno</i> is not affected by function calls or assignments to
<i>errno</i> by other threads.
<p>
Some functions return an error number directly as the function value.
These functions return a value of zero to indicate success.
<p>
If more than one error occurs in processing a function call,
any one of the possible errors may be returned, as the order
of detection is undefined.
<p>
Implementations may support additional errors not included in this
list, may generate errors included in this list under circumstances
other than those described here, or may contain extensions or limitations
that prevent some errors from occurring.  The ERRORS
section on each page specifies whether an error will be returned,
or whether it may be returned.  Implementations
will not generate a different error number from the ones described here
for error conditions described in this specification, but may
generate additional errors unless explicitly disallowed for a
particular function.
<p>
The following symbolic names identify the possible error numbers,
in the context of the functions specifically defined in this specification;
these general descriptions are more precisely defined in the
ERRORS sections of the functions that return them.
Only these symbolic names should be used in programs, since the
actual value of the error number is unspecified.
All values listed in this section are unique
except as noted below.
The values for all these names can be found in the header
<i><a href="errno42.htm">&lt;errno.h&gt;</a></i>.

<i><a href="getmsg.htm">getmsg()</a></i>
or
<i><a href="ioctl.htm">ioctl()</a></i>
I_RECVFD request to a STREAMS device, a message arrived at the head of the
STREAM that is inappropriate for the function receiving the message.
<ul>

<li>
<i><a href="read.htm">read()</a></i>
- message waiting to be read on a STREAM is not a data message.

function or a
<i><a href="kill.htm">kill()</a></i>
function).


<dt>[EIO]<dd><index term="EIO, "></index>

Input/output error

Some physical input or output error has occurred. This error may be

Inappropriate I/O control operation

A control function has been attempted for a file or special file for which
the operation is inappropriate.


<dt>[ENXIO]<dd><index term="ENXIO, "></index>

No such device or address

Input or output on a special file refers to a device that does not exist,
or makes a request beyond the capabilities of the device. It may also occur
when, for example, a tape drive is not on-line.

<dt>[EOPNOTSUPP]<dd><index term="EOPNOTSUPP, "></index>

Operation not supported on socket

The type of socket (address family or protocol) does not support
the requested operation.

<dt>[EOVERFLOW]<dd><index term="EOVERFLOW, "></index>

Value too large to be stored in data type

The user ID or group ID of an IPC or file system
object was too large to be stored into appropriate member of the
caller-provided structure.  This error will only occur on implementations that
support a larger range of user ID or group ID values than the
declared structure member can support.  This usually occurs because
the IPC or file system object resides on a remote machine with a larger
value of the type <b>uid_t</b>, <b>off_t</b> or <b>gid_t</b> than the local
system.

<dt>[EPERM]<dd><index term="EPERM, "></index>

Operation not permitted

An attempt was made to perform an operation limited to processes with
appropriate privileges or to the owner of a file or other resource.

<dt>[EPIPE]<dd><index term="EPIPE, "></index>

Broken pipe

A write was attempted on a
&nbsp;socket,
&nbsp;pipe or FIFO for which there is no process to read the data.

<dt>[EPROTO]<dd><index term="EPROTO, "></index>

Protocol error

Some protocol error occurred.  This error is device specific, but is generally
not related to a hardware failure.

<dt>[EPROTONOSUPPORT]<dd><index term="EPROTONOSUPPORT, "></index>

Protocol not supported

The protocol is not supported by the address family, or
the protocol is not supported by the implementation.

<dt>[EPROTOTYPE]<dd><index term="EPROTOTYPE, "></index>

Socket type not supported

The socket type is not supported by the protocol.

<dt>[ERANGE]<dd><index term="ERANGE, "></index>

Result too large or too small

The result of the function is too large (overflow) or too small (underflow)
to be represented in the available space.
(Defined in the ISO&nbsp;C standard.)

<dt>[EROFS]<dd><index term="EROFS, "></index>

Read-only file system

An attempt was made to modify a file or directory on a file system that
is read only.

pipe or FIFO.


<dt>[ESRCH]<dd><index term="ESRCH, "></index>

No such process

No process can be found corresponding to that specified by the given process
ID.

<dt>[ESTALE]<dd><index term="ESTALE, "></index>

Reserved

<dt>[ETIME]<dd><index term="ETIME, "></index>

STREAM
<i><a href="ioctl.htm">ioctl()</a></i>
timeout

The timer set for a STREAMS
<i><a href="ioctl.htm">ioctl()</a></i>
call has expired.  The cause of this error is device specific and could
indicate either a hardware or software failure, or a timeout value that is too
short for the specific operation.  The status of the
<i><a href="ioctl.htm">ioctl()</a></i>
operation is indeterminate.

<dt>[ETIMEDOUT]<dd><index term="ETIMEDOUT, "></index>

Connection timed out

The connection to a remote machine has timed out.  If the connection timed out
during execution of the function that reported this error (as opposed to
timing out prior to the function being called), it is unspecified whether the
function has completed some or all of the documented behaviour associated with
a successful completion of the function.

<dt>[ETIMEDOUT]<dd><index term="ETIMEDOUT, "></index>

Operation timed out

The time limit associated with the operation was exceeded before the
operation completed.

<dt>[ETXTBSY]<dd><index term="ETXTBSY, "></index>

Text file busy

An attempt was made to execute a pure-procedure program that is currently
open for writing, or an attempt has been made to open for writing a
pure-procedure program that is being executed.

<dt>[EWOULDBLOCK]<dd><index term="EWOULDBLOCK, "></index>

Operation would block

An operation on a socket marked as non-blocking has encountered a
situation such as no data available that otherwise would have
caused the function to suspend execution.

An XSI-conforming implementation may assign the same values for
[EWOULDBLOCK] and [EAGAIN].

<dt>[EXDEV]<dd><index term="EXDEV, "></index>

Improper link

A link to a file on another file system was attempted.
