<h4><a name = "tag_000_004_101">&nbsp;</a>NAME</h4><blockquote>
fattach - attach a STREAMS-based file descriptor to a file
in the file system name space
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_004_102">&nbsp;</a>SYNOPSIS</h4><blockquote>
<pre><code>

#include &lt;<a href="strop263.htm">stropts.h</a>&gt;

int fattach(int <i>fildes</i>, const char *<i>path</i>);
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_004_103">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>fattach()</i>
function attaches a STREAMS-based file descriptor to a file, effectively
associating a pathname with <i>fildes</i>.  The <i>fildes</i> argument must be a
valid open file descriptor associated with a STREAMS file.  The <i>path</i>
argument points to a pathname of an existing file.  The process must have
appropriate privileges, or must be the owner of the file named by <i>path</i>
and have write permission.  A successful call to
<i>fattach()</i>
causes all pathnames that name the file named by
<i>path</i>
to name the STREAMS file associated with
<i>fildes</i>,
until the STREAMS file is detached from the file.  A STREAMS file can be
attached to more than one file and can have several pathnames associated with
it.
<p>
The attributes of the named STREAMS file are initialised as follows: the
permissions, user ID, group ID, and times are set to those of the file named
by <i>path</i>, the number of links is set to 1, and the size and device
identifier are set to those of the STREAMS file associated with <i>fildes</i>.
If any attributes of the named STREAMS file are subsequently changed (for
example, by
<i><a href="chmod.htm">chmod()</a></i>),
neither the attributes of the underlying file nor the attributes of the
STREAMS file to which
<i>fildes</i>
refers are affected.
<p>
File descriptors referring to the underlying file, opened prior to an
<i>fattach()</i>
call, continue to refer to the underlying file.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_004_104">&nbsp;</a>RETURN VALUE</h4><blockquote>
Upon successful completion,
<i>fattach()</i>
returns 0.  Otherwise, -1 is returned and
<i>errno</i> is set to indicate the error.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_004_105">&nbsp;</a>ERRORS</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>fattach()</i>
function will fail if:
<dl compact>

<dt>[EACCES]<dd>
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix, or
the process is the owner of <i>path</i> but does not have write
permissions on the file named by <i>path</i>.

<dt>[EBADF]<dd>
The <i>fildes</i> argument is not a valid open file descriptor.

<dt>[ENOENT]<dd>
A component of <i>path</i> does not name an existing file
or <i>path</i> is an empty string.

<dt>[ENOTDIR]<dd>
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

<dt>[EPERM]<dd>
The effective user ID of the process is not the owner of the file named by
<i>path</i> and the process does not have appropriate privilege.

<dt>[EBUSY]<dd>
The file named by <i>path</i> is currently a mount point or has a STREAMS file
attached to it.

<dt>[ENAMETOOLONG]<dd>

The size of <i>path</i> exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or
a component of <i>path</i> is longer than {NAME_MAX}.

<dt>[ELOOP]<dd>
Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving <i>path</i>.

</dl>
<br>
<p>
The
<i>fattach()</i>
function may fail if:
<dl compact>

<dt>[EINVAL]<dd>
The <i>fildes</i> argument does not refer to a STREAMS file.

<dt>[ENAMETOOLONG]<dd>

Pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate result whose
length exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

<dt>[EXDEV]<dd>
A link to a file on another file system was attempted.

</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_004_106">&nbsp;</a>EXAMPLES</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_004_107">&nbsp;</a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>fattach()</i>
function behaves similarly to the traditional
<i>mount()</i>
function in the way a file is temporarily replaced by the root
directory of the mounted file system.  In the case of
<i>fattach()</i>,
the replaced file need not be a directory and the replacing file is a STREAMS
file.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_004_108">&nbsp;</a>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</h4><blockquote>
None.
