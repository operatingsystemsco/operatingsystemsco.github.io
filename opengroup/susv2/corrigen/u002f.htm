<H1> Document: Structured Query Language (SQL)<BR></H1>


X/Open CAE Specification, August 1992<BR>
X/Open reference C201, ISBN 1-872630-58-8

<H3>Description</H3>
This document corrects errors in the SQL CAE Specification which X/Open and readers have located.
<P>
		In addition, ISO is preparing to publish a number of
		Technical Corrigenda with respect to the underlying
		International Standard, and may publish additional Technical
		Corrigenda. This X/Open document does not necessarily
		address all the subjects from these Technical Corrigenda.
		However, X/Open intends to align the SQL CAE Specification
		with the material in all such ISO documents, either in
		future X/Open Corrigenda documents, or in future editions of
		the SQL CAE Specification.

<H3>Contents</H3>
<DT>All changes (1.1 to 1.7) are minor.
<DL>
<DD>Changes 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.6 are technical.
<DD>Changes 1.1 and 1.2 were formerly implicit or inferrable.
<DD>Changes 1.3 and 1.6 are for ISO alignment.

<DD>Missing SQLSTATE 'S0022'
<P>
<DT><H3>Qualifier</H3>
<DD>Minor Technical
<P>
<DT><H3>Rationale</H3>
<DD>An SQLSTATE value and a set of DIAGNOSTICS is missing from
		the SQL CAE Specification. SQLSTATE values in class 'S0'
		are symmetrically allocated for the cases of a duplicate or
		missing table, index or column. However, the specific case
		of a missing column is not defined.

<P>
<DT><H3>Change</H3><DL>

<DT>                (1) Add the following DIAGNOSTIC to the descriptions of
		CREATE INDEX (Section 5.3.3 on page 65) and GRANT
		(Section 5.3.9 on page 71):
<DD>   	  Any specified column-identifier must already exist
		  ('S0022').
<P>
<DT>		(2) A slightly different wording is warranted for CREATE
		TABLE (Section 5.3.4 on page 67):
<DD>		  Any column-identifier specified in a constraint
		  (referencing a table other than the one being
		  created) must already exist ('S0022').
<P>
<DT>		(The column-identifiers in ALTER TABLE need not already
		exist, as the ALTER TABLE statement brings them into
		existence. The various DROP statements and the REVOKE
		statements do not let the applications specify
		individual columns.)
<P>
<DT>		(3) Moreover, add an entry for 'S0022' to Appendix B on
		page 136:
<DD>		  S0 022 - Column not found. 5.3.3,4,5,9

<DT><H3>Qualifier</H3>
<DD>Minor Technical
<P>
<DT><H3>Rationale</H3>
<DD>In three additional cases to those described in the previous
		section, diagnostics were omitted from the SQL CAE
		Specification.
<P>
<DT><H3>Change</H3><DL>
<DT>		(1) In Section 5.3.6 on page 69 (DROP INDEX), add the
		following paragraph at the end of DIAGNOSTICS:

<DD>		  The index-name must identify an index that already
		  exists ('S0012').
<P>
<DT>		(2) In Section 5.3.7 on page 69 (DROP TABLE), add a
		DIAGNOSTICS section with a single paragraph:

<DD>		  The base-table-name must identify a table that
		  already exists ('S0002').
<P>
<DT>		(3) In Section 5.3.8 on page 69 (DROP VIEW), add a
		DIAGNOSTICS section (on page 70) with a single
		paragraph:

<DD>		  The viewed-table-name must identify a table that
		  already exists ('S0002').
<P>
<DT>		(4) In Appendix B, revise the second table on page 136,
		changing the section references for 'S0002' and adding
		an entry for 'S0012':
<DD>		  S0 002 - Base table not found. 5.3.3,7,8
<DD>		  S0 012 - Index not found. 5.3.6

<DD>Reversed Syntax in DECLARE CURSOR
<P>
<DT><H3>Qualifier</H3>
<DD>Minor Technical
<P>
<DT><H3>Rationale</H3>
<DD>In the description of the DECLARE CURSOR statement in
		Section 4.3.1 on page 49, under query-expression, the
		optional FOR clause (which may be FOR READ ONLY or FOR
		UPDATE) and ORDER BY appear in an order that is reversed
		compared to the International Standard.
<P>
		This deviation from the International Standard is
		inadvertent. If an ORDER BY clause appears in a DECLARE
		CURSOR statement, it must precede any FOR READ ONLY or FOR
		UPDATE clause.
<P>
<DT><H3>Change</H3><DL>
<DT>Reverse the appearance of the two clauses in Section 4.3.1
		on page 49, and again in Section A.2 on page 127.

<DD>Keyword Alignment with the International Standard
<P>
<DT><H3>Qualifier</H3>
<DD>Minor Editorial
<P>
<DT><H3>Rationale</H3>
<DD>The keywords list in Section 3.1.3 on page 22 must be
		aligned with that found in the published International
		Standard.
<P>
<DD>		The SQL CAE Specification lists five keywords as reserved
		(unavailable for use as user-defined names), but follows
		them by an asterisk to indicate that "X/Open SQL does not
		use these keywords, but they are defined in the
		International Standard." As they do not appear in the
		International Standard, they should be removed from the
		table. This applies to the following keywords: DICTIONARY,
		DISPLACEMENT, IGNORE, OFF, SYSTEM.
<P>
<DD>		The International Standard lists additional keywords not
		contained in the table in the SQL CAE Specification. These
		keywords should be added to the table in the SQL CAE
		Specification (each with an asterisk, as they are not yet
		used in X/Open SQL): ACTION, BOTH, CROSS, CURRENT_USER,
		LEADING, NATURAL, NO, PAD, RELATIVE, SESSION, SESSION_USER,
		SPACE, SYSTEM_USER, TRAILING, and TRIM.

<P>
<DT><H3>Change</H3><DL>
<DT>Modify the keywords list in Section 3.1.3 on page 22 as
		described above.

<DD>Correction in Comparison to the International Standard
<P>
<DT><H3>Qualifier</H3>
<DD>Minor Editorial
<P>
<DT><H3>Rationale</H3>
<DD>Appendix C compares the SQL CAE Specification to the
		International Standard. The introduction to the Appendix
		defines X/Open-compliance of an implementation as the
		implementation of both of the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>		All Entry level features from the International
		Standard, except as described in Section C.1
<P>
<LI>		Features enumerated in Section C.2 and Section C.3.
<P>
</UL>
<DD>		In general, X/Open-compliant implementations must implement
		deprecated features even though X/Open intends to remove
		them from a future edition of the specification. However,
		all the deprecated features described in the SQL CAE
		Specification are also marked optional.
<P>
<DD>		Appendix C lists only one of the deprecated features, the
		INCLUDE SQLCA directive. Since this feature is optional, it
		should not be listed in Section C.3 as an extension to the
		International Standard, giving the impression that it is
		mandatory.
<P>
<DD>		Readers should note that SQLCODE is deprecated and optional
		in the SQL CAE Specification. However, in the International
		Standard, SQLCODE is deprecated and mandatory.

<P>
<DT><H3>Change</H3><DL>
<DT>On page 141, delete the first bulleted paragraph on the
		page.

<DD>COLUMNS System View
<P>
<DT><H3>Qualifier</H3>
<DD>Minor Technical
<P>
<DT><H3>Rationale</H3>
<DD>In Section 6.2 on page 105 (COLUMNS System View), the
		description of the NULLABLE column is inconsistent with text
		in the published International Standard.
<P>
<DD>		In addition, the SQL CAE Specification does not specify the
		value of the NUMERIC_PREC_RADIX column for exact numeric
		data. (This contradicts the statement that an application
		could combine precision and radix to calculate the maximum
		number that a column can hold.)

<P>
<DT><H3>Change</H3><DL>
<DT>		(1) In Section 6.2 on page 105, change one line in the VIEW
		DEFINITION from

<DD>		  NULLABLE CHAR(3),

<DD>		to

<DD>		  IS_NULLABLE VARCHAR(254),
<P>
<DT>		(2) On page 105, in the paragraph describing
		NUMERIC_PRECISION, replace the text with the following:
<P>
		  If DATA_TYPE is an approximate numeric data type,
		  this column contains the number of bits of
		  mantissa precision of the column. For exact
		  numeric data types, this column contains the total
		  number of decimal digits allowed in the column.
		  Otherwise, this column is null.
		  NUMERIC_PREC_RADIX (see below) indicates the units
		  of measurement.

<DT>		This new paragraph does not represent a substantive
		change to the prior text.
<P>
<DT>		(3) On page 105, in the paragraph describing
		NUMERIC_PREC_RADIX, replace the text with the
		following:
<P>
<DD>		  COLUMNS System View
<P>
<DD>		  If DATA_TYPE is an approximate numeric data type,
		  this column contains the value 2 because
		  NUMERIC_PRECISION specifies a number of bits. For
		  exact numeric data types, this column contains the
		  value 10 because NUMERIC_PRECISION specifies a
		  number of decimal digits. Otherwise, this column
		  is null. By combining the precision with the
		  radix, an application can calculate the maximum
		  number that the column can hold.
<P>
<DT>		Only the second sentence of this new paragraph
		represents a substantive change to the prior text.
<P>
<DT>		(4) On page 106, in the paragraph describing NULLABLE,
		change the heading NULLABLE to IS_NULLABLE and change
		"Contains a 3-character value:" to "Contains the
		value".

<DD>Typographical Errors
<P>
<DT><H3>Qualifier</H3>
<DD>Minor Editorial
<P>
<DT><H3>Rationale</H3>
<DD>In Section 6.2 on page 105 (COLUMNS System View), the
		description of the NULLABLE column is inconsistent with text
		in the published International Standard.
<P>
<DD>		In addition, the SQL CAE Specification does not specify the
		value of the NUMERIC_PREC_RADIX column for exact numeric
		data. (This contradicts the statement that an application
		could combine precision and radix to calculate the maximum
		number that a column can hold.)

<P>
<DT><H3>Change</H3><DL>
<DT>		The following typographical errors should be corrected:
<P>
<DD>		(1) In Section 3.2.2 ("Data Types of Expressions"), the
		word expression near the top of page 26 should be
		followed by a reference to Section 3.3 on page 31,
		where the term is defined.
<P>
<DD>		(2) In the last paragraph of Section 3.2.2, also on page
		26, change "a set functions" to "a set function".
<P>
<DD>		(3) In Appendix A.1 on page 123, under character-string-
		type, CHAR should be shown as a synonymous alternative
		for CHARACTER (as VARCHAR is shown). On page 124,
		under exact-numeric-type, INT should be shown as a
		synonymous alternative for INTEGER. DEC should be
		shown as a synonymous alternative for DECIMAL, with the
		same optional precision and scale.
<P>
<DD>		(4) In Appendix A.1 on page 125, under like-predicate, the
		four lines directly following pattern-value should be
		indented.
