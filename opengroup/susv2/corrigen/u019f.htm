Change number:   XO_DLPI-2

Title:           Additional data link services supported by the DLPI

Qualifier:       Major Technical

Rationale:       In the DLPI CAE Specification (C614), it is partly
                 stated in the &quot;This Document&quot; of the Preface, and 
                 fully stated in Chapter 1 Section 1.1, that:

                   The Data Link Provider Interface (DLPI) enables 
                   a data link service user to access and use any 
                   of a variety of conforming data link service 
                   providers without special knowledge of the 
                   provider's protocol.

                   Specifically, the interface is intended to support 
                   X.25 LAPB, BX.25 level 2, SDLC, ISDN LAPD, Ethernet, 
                   CSMA/CD, FDDI, token ring, token bus, Bisync, 
                   Frame Relay, ATM, Fiber Channel and HIPPI. Among 
                   the expected data link service users are 
                   implementations of the OSI network layer and 
                   SNA path control.

                 and that:

                   Readers should note that the list of data links 
                   supported by the interface may be augmented and 
                   is published on the World-Wide Web in the DLPI 
                   Corrigendum U019, at http://www.xopen.org (under
                   &quot;Sales and Ordering&quot;). This Corrigendum will 
                   contain relevant additional information such as 
                   recognized implementors' agreements/guidelines
                   for common data link providers. A printed copy 
                   of this Web page may also be obtained from 
                   The Open Group on request (address on inside front 
                   page of this DLPI specification).

                 This Corrigendum fulfils this role as defined in the 
                 DLPI CAE Specification C614.

                      www.opengroup.org/public/pubs/catalog/u019
                    This should be updated in the Preface &quot;This Document&quot;
                    and in Chapter 1 Section 1.1.

                 2. The following additional data links are currently 
                    supported:

                      Native ATM Services. See the ATM Forum Publication 
                      AF-SAA-API-DLPI-0091.000 &quot;Native ATM Services
