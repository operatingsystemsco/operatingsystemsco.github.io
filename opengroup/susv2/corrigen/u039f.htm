Change Number: U039/XSSO-001

Title: Allow Module Pathname definition for PAM modules using ISA

Qualifier: Minor technical

Rationale: The existing definition of the Module Path field does not
allow for systems that support multiple concurrent 
instruction set architectures (ISA) to place PAM modules 
in directories relative to the ISA. This change is designed 
to permit such implementations.

The problem is solved if the pathname contains the $ISA 
token. That token is then replaced by an implementation
defined directory name which defines the path relative 
to the calling program's instruction set architecture.

Existing Module Path fields are unaffected. This change 
permits applications with different instruction set 
architectures (ISA) to be able to find modules with a 
corresponding ISA. It is possible to use relative Module 
Path fields for those modules contained in the 
implementation-defined base directory; however this
solution would not allow modules supplied by add-on 
packages to be named with absolute path names to where 
the add-on packages are naturally stored, but must be 
relocated under implementation-defined base directory. 

Change: On page 30, section 5.6.4:

change

/usr/lib/security/pam_<service_name>_<module_name>.<extension>

to

/usr/lib/security/$ISA/pam_<service_name>_<module_name>.<extension>

and add immediately below it the following explanation:

     If the pathname contains the $ISA token, that token 
     is replaced by an implementation-defined directory 
     name which defines the path relative to the calling 
     program's instruction set architecture.
