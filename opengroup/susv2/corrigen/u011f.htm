<DT><H3>Rationale</H3>
<DD>An implementation that always executes in transactional mode
            and never in non-transactional mode, provides implicit transaction
            demarcation in the case that an AP (client) calls a service outside
            of a transaction.<BR>
            In such an implementation, when a transactional AP calls a service,
            the AP uses the TX (Transaction Demarcation) interface explicitly.
            In such an implementation, when a non-transactional AP calls a
            service, a transaction is implicitly started before the service
            itself starts; the transaction is automatically completed with the
            end of the service. The service can only participate in the
            implicitly opened transaction.<BR>
            In either case, any CRM-specific constraints on transaction
            demarcation are applicable in the normal way.

<P>
<DT><H3>Change</H3>
<DL><DT>Add as last paragraph in<BR>
3.3 Beginning and Completing Global Transactions<BR>
on page 11:
<P>
<DL><DT><DD>In a distributed environment a subordinate node may  execute in
transaction mandatory mode.  In this case either the AP at the subordinate side
participates in the transaction opened by the AP at the superior node
or a transaction is implicitly opened before the AP is invoked.  In either case
the tx_begin() function fails because the calling AP is already in
transaction mode.  CRM specific constraints are applicable in the normal way.
<P></DL>
Add the following paragraph in<BR>
the Public information section<BR>
on page 54:
<P>
<DL><DT><DD>TM products must specify whether they support non transactional processing
or not.
