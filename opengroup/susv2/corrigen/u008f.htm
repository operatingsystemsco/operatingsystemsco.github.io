<h3>Rationale</h3>

<dl>
    <dd>The &lt;xti.h&gt; header file specifies binary values for
        symbolic constants. It also includes protocol specific
        symbolic constants. Some of these constants defined
        values can conflict with values already defined on a
        vendors platform in other header files and can therefore
        cause name space and binary compatibility problems. This
        is manifest by XTI as part of the Single UNIX
        specification. <p>The XNET-36 meeting addressed this
        problem as a matter of urgency, with the aim of
        recommending a solution which would avoid delaying
        development of the Single UNIX test suite. Leaving aside
        considerations of binary portability, and also argument
        over how it came about that the developers of the earlier
        XTI specification came to specify binary values in the
        first place, the arguments for the two opposing positions
        expressed during XNET-36 (on the numerical values
        assigned to symbolic constants in the XPG4 &lt;xti.h&gt;
        file) were: </p>
        <p>- the xti.h values should stay mandatory since there
        may be applications out there which rely on XTI
        implementations making exactly these values available </p>
        <p>- these values should be made only illustrative since
        some new implementors of XTI already have transport
        providers with other values implemented and they wish
        neither to migrate them and corresponding applications to
        the XPG4 XTI values nor to maintain dual transport
        providers. </p>
        <p>XNET-36 captured its majority position in Resolution
        36-8: </p>
        <dl>
            <dd>&quot;XNET recommends that regarding the
                mandatory character of the current XTI header
                definition, specifically the binary values
                specified therein, the values as specified in the
                list to be agreed should not be mandatory for the
                purposes of the UNIX brand, while they should
                remain mandatory for branding in other
                environments.&quot;</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>In recommending this solution, XNET recognised it was
        proposing introducing a slight difference in the meaning
        of the XTI brand obtained for Single UNIX and that
        obtained for other environments: existing and new XTI
        applications written for non-UNIX environments will not
        be fully portable to the Single UNIX environment (there
        is no problem in the opposite direction). </p>
        <p>Regarding the scale and context of this problem, it is
        important to note that only applications relying on
        specific numerical values of the symbolic constants would
        have to be modified when ported to XTI implementations
        providing different values. Of course, the purpose of
        symbolic constants is to remove numerical values from
        programs, and textbooks on programming generally advise
        against a style making programs dependent on numerical
        values. It is therefore to be hoped that the problem is
        limited to only a rather small number of applications
        written in questionable style, and therefore in practice
        this should not be a major technical issue. </p>
        <p>The whole matter is significant because of its
        branding implications. The compromise expressed in XNET
        resolution 36-8, namely a single XTI brand with different
        conformance requirements in UNIX and XPG4 environments,
        proved not acceptable. </p>
        <p>As a result, X/Open proposed that the Appendix on the
        XTI header file is modified so that some or all of the
        values included therein are declared as &quot;recommended
        but not mandatory&quot; for compliance with the XTI
        specification. In a preliminary poll of XNET
        representatives, this solution was accepted, with a
        slight preference for making &quot;recommended but not
        mandatory&quot; only those values which cause contention.
        </p>
        <p>The change proposed here does this. If accepted, it
        will be issued as a Corrigendum to ensure immediate
        effect. </p>

<h3>Change</h3>

<dl>
    <dt>In the Networking Services Issue 4 CAE Specification,
        Appendix F: Headers and Definitions for XTI: </dt>
    <dd><dl>
            <dt>(1) After the first paragraph in Appendix F (on
                Page 253), add the following new paragraph: </dt>
            <dd>&quot;Values specified for some of the symbolic
                constants in this XTI header definition are
                designated as not mandatory for conformance
                purposes. These are identified by the comment<br>
                /* value is recommended only, not mandatory */<br>
                on the same line as that constant.&quot; </dd>
            <dt>(2) Add a comment<br>
                /* value is recommended only, not mandatory */<br>
                to the following constants (in the change details
                below, the side headings are included solely for
                ease of identification in the existing Appendix
                F, and will not be duplicated in Appendix F): </dt>
