<P><B><FONT SIZE=+4>T</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=-1>he four main elements of
the&nbsp;<A NAME="COCOMOII"></A>COCOMO II strategy are:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Preserve the openness of the original COCOMO;</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Key the structure of COCOMO II to the future software marketplace
sectors described earlier;</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Key the inputs and outputs of the COCOMO II submodels to
the level of information available;</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Enable the COCOMO II submodels to be tailored to a project's
particular process strategy.</FONT></LI>
</UL>
<FONT SIZE=-1>COCOMO II follows the openness principles used in the original
COCOMO. Thus, all of its relationships and algorithms will be publicly
available. Also, all of its interfaces are designed to be public, well-defined,
and parametrized, so that complementary preprocessors (analogy, case-based,
or other size estimation models), post-processors (project planning and
control tools, project dynamics models, risk analyzers), and higher level
packages (project management packages, product negotiation aids), can be
combined straightforwardly with COCOMO II.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>To support the software marketplace sectors above, COCOMO
II provides a family of increasingly detailed software cost estimation
models, each tuned to the sectors' needs and type of information available
to support software cost estimation.</FONT>
<P><A NAME="COCOMOIIModels"></A><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">COCOMO II Models
for the Software Marketplace Sectors</FONT></I></B>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The COCOMO II capability for estimation of&nbsp;<A NAME="ApplicationGenerator"></A><U>Application
Generator</U>,&nbsp;<A NAME="SystemIntegration"></A><U>System Integration</U>,
or&nbsp;<A NAME="Infrastructure"></A><U>Infrastructure</U> developments
is based on two increasingly detailed estimation models for subsequent
portions of the life cycle, <I>Early Design</I> and <I>Post-Architecture</I>.</FONT>
<P><A NAME="COCOMOIIModelRationale"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">COCOMO II Model
Rationale and Elaboration</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The rationale for providing this tailorable mix of models
rests on three primary premises.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1><U>First</U>, unlike the initial COCOMO situation in the
late 1970's, in which there was a single, preferred software life cycle
model, current and future software projects will be tailoring their processes
to their particular process drivers. These process drivers include&nbsp;<A NAME="COTS"></A>COTS
or reusable software availability; degree of understanding of architectures
and requirements; market window or other schedule constraints; size; and
required reliability (see [Boehm 1989, pp. 436-37] for an example of such
tailoring guidelines).</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1><U>Second</U>, the granularity of the software cost estimation
model used needs to be consistent with the granularity of the information
available to support software cost estimation. In the early stages of a
software project, very little may be known about the size of the product
to be developed, the nature of the target platform, the nature of the personnel
to be involved in the project, or the detailed specifics of the process
to be used.</FONT>
<P><IMG SRC="figI-1.jpg" HEIGHT=392 WIDTH=558>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Figure I-1:&nbsp; Software Costing and Sizing Accuracy vs. Phase</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Figure I-1, extended from [Boehm 1981, p. 311], indicates
the effect of project uncertainties on the accuracy of software size and
cost estimates. In the very early stages, one may not know the specific
nature of the product to be developed to better than a factor of 4. As
the life cycle proceeds, and product decisions are made, the nature of
the products and its consequent size are better known, and the nature of
the process and its consequent cost drivers are better known. The earlier
"completed programs" size and effort data points in Figure I-1 are the
actual sizes and efforts of seven software products built to an imprecisely-defined
specification [Boehm et. al. 1984]. The later "USAF/ESD proposals" data
points are from five proposals submitted to the U.S. Air Force Electronic
Systems Division in response to a fairly thorough specification [Devenny
1976].</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1><U>Third</U>, given the situation in premises 1 and 2,
COCOMO II enables projects to furnish coarse-grained cost driver information
in the early project stages, and increasingly fine-grained information
in later stages. Consequently, COCOMO II does not produce point estimates
of software cost and effort, but rather range estimates tied to the degree
of definition of the estimation inputs. The uncertainty ranges in Figure
I-1 are used as starting points for these estimation ranges.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>With respect to&nbsp;<A NAME="processstrategy"></A><U>process
strategy</U>, Application Generator, System Integration, and Infrastructure
software projects will involve a mix of three major process models, The
appropriate models will depend on the project marketplace drivers and degree
of product understanding.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The&nbsp;<A NAME="EarlyDesign"></A><U>Early Design</U>
model involves exploration of alternative software/system architectures
and concepts of operation. At this stage, not enough is generally known
to support fine-grain cost estimation. The corresponding COCOMO II capability
involves the use of function points and a course-grained set of 7 cost
drivers (e.g. two cost drivers for Personnel Capability and Personnel Experience
in place of the 6 COCOMO II Post-Architecture model cost drivers covering
various aspects of personnel capability, continuity, and experience).</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The&nbsp;<A NAME="PostArchitecture"></A><U>Post-Architecture</U>
model involves the actual development and maintenance of a software product.
This stage proceeds most cost-effectively if a software life-cycle architecture
has been developed; validated with respect to the system's mission, concept
of operation, and risk; and established as the framework for the product.
The corresponding COCOMO II model has about the same granularity as the
previous COCOMO and Ada COCOMO models. It uses source instructions and
/ or function points for sizing, with modifiers for reuse and software
breakage; a set of 17 multiplicative cost drivers; and a set of 5 factors
determining the project's scaling exponent. These factors replace the development
modes (Organic, Semidetached, or Embedded) in the original COCOMO model,
and refine the four exponent-scaling factors in Ada COCOMO.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>To summarize, COCOMO II provides the following three-stage
series of models for estimation of Application Generator, System Integration,
and Infrastructure software projects:</FONT>
<OL>
<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>The earliest phases or spiral cycles will generally involve
prototyping, using the&nbsp;<A NAME="ApplicationComposition"></A>Application
Composition model capabilities. The COCOMO II Application Composition model
supports these phases, and any other prototyping activities occurring later
in the life cycle.</FONT></LI>

<LI VALUE="2">
<FONT SIZE=-1>The next phases or spiral cycles will generally involve exploration
of architectural alternatives or incremental development strategies. To
support these activities, COCOMO II provides an early estimation model
called the Early Design model. This level of detail in this model is consistent
with the general level of information available and the general level of
estimation accuracy needed at this stage.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Once the project is ready to develop and sustain a fielded
system, it should have a life- cycle architecture, which provides more
accurate information on cost driver inputs, and enables more accurate cost
estimates. To support this stage, COCOMO II provides the Post-Architecture
model.</FONT></LI>
</OL>
<FONT SIZE=-1>The above should be considered as current working hypotheses
about the most effective forms for COCOMO II. They will be subject to revision
based on subsequent data analysis. Data analysis should also enable the
further calibration of the relationships between object points, function
points, and source lines of code for various languages and composition
systems, enabling flexibility in the choice of sizing parameters.</FONT>
<P><A NAME="DevelopmentEffortEstimates"></A><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Development
Effort Estimates</FONT></I></B>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>In COCOMO II effort is expressed as Person Months (PM).
person month is the amount of time one person spends working on the software
development project for one month. This number is exclusive of holidays
and vacations but accounts for weekend time off. The number of person months
is different from the time it will take the project to complete; this is
called the development schedule. For example, a project may be estimated
to require 50 PM of effort but have a schedule of 11 months.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Equation I-1 is the base model for the Early Design and
Post-Architecture cost estimation models. The inputs are the <I>Size</I>
of software development, a constant, <I>A</I>, and a scale factor, <I>B</I>.
The size is in units of thousands of source lines of code (KSLOC). This
is derived from estimating the size of software modules that will constitute
the application program. It can also be estimated from&nbsp;<A NAME="unadjustedfunctionpoints"></A>unadjusted
function points (UFP), converted to SLOC then divided by one thousand.
Procedures for counting SLOC or UFP are explained in the chapters on the
Post- Architecture and Early Design models respectively.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The scale (or exponential) factor, <I>B</I>, accounts
for the relative economies or diseconomies of scale encountered for software
projects of different sizes [Banker et al 1994a]. The constant, <I>A</I>,
is used to capture the multiplicative effects on effort with projects of
increasing size. The nominal effort for a given size project and expressed
as person months (PM) is given by Equation I-1.</FONT>

<P><A NAME="SoftwareEconomies"></A><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Software Economies
and Diseconomies of Scale</FONT></I></B>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Software cost estimation models often have an exponential
factor to account for the relative economies or diseconomies of scale encountered
in different size software projects. The exponent, <I>B</I>, in Equation
I-1 is used to capture these effects.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>If <I>B &lt; 1.0</I>, the project exhibits economies of
scale. If the product's size is doubled, the project effort is less than
doubled. The project's productivity increases as the product size is increased.
Some project economies of scale can be achieved via project-specific tools
(e.g., simulations, testbeds) but in general these are difficult to achieve.
For small projects, fixed start-up costs such as tool tailoring and setup
of standards and administrative reports are often a source of economies
of scale.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>If <I>B = 1.0</I>, the economies and diseconomies of scale
are in balance. This linear model is often used for cost estimation of
small projects. It is used for the COCOMO II <I>Applications Composition</I>
model.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>If <I>B > 1.0</I>, the project exhibits diseconomies of
scale. This is generally due to two main factors: growth of interpersonal
communications overhead and growth of large-system integration overhead.
Larger projects will have more personnel, and thus more interpersonal communications
paths consuming overhead. Integrating a small product as part of a larger
product requires not only the effort to develop the small product, but
also the additional overhead effort to design, maintain, integrate, and
test its interfaces with the remainder of the product.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>See [Banker et al 1994a] for a further discussion of software
economies and diseconomies of scale.</FONT>
<P><A NAME="PreviousApproaches"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">Previous Approaches</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The data analysis on the original COCOMO indicated that
its projects exhibited net diseconomies of scale. The projects factored
into three classes or modes of software development (Organic, Semidetached,
and Embedded), whose exponents <I>B</I> were 1.05, 1.12, and 1.20, respectively.
The distinguishing factors of these modes were basically environmental:
Embedded-mode projects were more unprecedented, requiring more communication
overhead and complex integration; and less flexible, requiring more communications
overhead and extra effort to resolve issues within tight schedule, budget,
interface, and performance constraints.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The scaling model in&nbsp;<A NAME="AdaCOCOMO"></A>Ada
COCOMO continued to exhibit diseconomies of scale, but recognized that
a good deal of the diseconomy could be reduced via management controllables.
Communications overhead and integration overhead could be reduced significantly
by early risk and error elimination; by using thorough, validated architectural
specifications; and by stabilizing requirements. These practices were combined
into an Ada process model [Boehm and Royce 1989, Royce 1990]. The project's
use of these practices, and an Ada process model experience or maturity
factor, were used in Ada COCOMO to determine the scale factor <I>B</I>.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Ada COCOMO applied this approach to only one of the COCOMO
development modes, the Embedded mode. Rather than a single exponent <I>B
= 1.20</I> for this mode, Ada COCOMO enabled <I>B</I> to vary from 1.04
to 1.24, depending on the project's progress in reducing diseconomies of
scale via early risk elimination, solid architecture, stable requirements,
and Ada process maturity.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>COCOMO II combines the COCOMO and Ada COCOMO scaling approaches
into a single rating-driven model. It is similar to that of Ada COCOMO
in having additive factors applied to a base exponent <I>B</I>. It includes
the Ada COCOMO factors, but combines the architecture and risk factors
into a single factor, and replaces the Ada process maturity factor with
a Software Engineering Institute (SEI) process maturity factor (The exact
form of this factor is still being worked out with the SEI). The scaling
model also adds two factors, precedentedness and flexibility, to account
for the mode effects in original COCOMO, and adds a Team Cohesiveness factor
to account for the diseconomy-of-scale effects on software projects whose
developers, customers, and users have difficulty in synchronizing their
efforts. It does not include the Ada COCOMO Requirements Volatility factor,
which is now covered by increasing the effective product size via the Breakage
factor.</FONT>
<P><A NAME="ScalingDrivers"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">Scaling Drivers</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Equation I-2 defines the exponent, <I>B</I>, used in Equation
I-1. Table I-1 provides the rating levels for the COCOMO II scale drivers.
The selection of scale drivers is based on the rationale that they are
a significant source of exponential variation on a project’s effort or
productivity variation. Each scale driver has a range of rating levels,
from Very Low to Extra High. Each rating level has a weight, <I>W</I>,
and the specific value of the weight is called a scale factor. A project's
scale factors, <I>W</I><SUB>i</SUB>, are summed across all of the factors,
and used to determine a scale exponent, <I>B,</I> via the following formula:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><FONT SIZE=-2>(EQ I-2)</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><IMG SRC="eqI-2.jpg" HEIGHT=57 WIDTH=196>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>For example, if scale factors with an Extra High rating
are each assigned a weight of (0), then a 100 KSLOC project with Extra
High ratings for all factors will have<FONT FACE="Symbol">&aring;</FONT>
<I>W</I><SUB>i</SUB>
<I>=
0, B = 1.01</I>, and a relative effort <I>E = 100<SUP>1.01</SUP>= 105 PM</I>.
If scale factors with Very Low rating are each assigned a weight of (5),
then a project with Very Low (5) ratings for all factors will have<FONT FACE="Symbol">&aring;</FONT>
<I>W</I><SUB>i</SUB><I>=
25, B = 1.26</I>, and a relative effort <I>E = 331 PM</I>. This represents
a large variation, but the increase involved in a one-unit change in one
of the factors is only about 4.7%.</FONT>

<A NAME="TeamCohesion"></A><FONT FACE="Arial">Team Cohesion (TEAM)</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The Team Cohesion scale factor accounts for the sources
of project turbulence and entropy due to difficulties in synchronizing
the project’s stakeholders: users, customers, developers, maintainers,
interfacers, others. These difficulties may arise from differences in stakeholder
objectives and cultures; difficulties in reconciling objectives; and stakeholder’s
lack of experience and familiarity in operating as a team. Table I-4 provides
a detailed definition for the overall TEAM rating levels. The final rating
is the subjective weighted average of the listed characteristics.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The second is organized around the 18 Key Process Areas
(KPAs) in the SEI Capability Maturity Model [Paulk et al. 1993, 1993a].
The procedure for determining PMAT is to decide the percentage of compliance
for each of the KPAs. If the project has undergone a recent CMM Assessment
then the percentage compliance for the overall KPA (based on KPA Key Practice
compliance assessment data) is used. If an assessment has not been done
then the levels of compliance to the KPA’s goals are used (with the Likert
scale below) to set the level of compliance. The goal-based level of compliance
is determined by a judgement-based averaging across the goals for each
Key Process Area. If more information is needed on the KPA goals, they
are listed in Appendix C of this document.</FONT>

drivers that have a multiplicative effect on predicting effort are called&nbsp;<A NAME="EffortMultipliers"></A>Effort
Multipliers (EM). Each EM has a rating level that expresses the impact
of the multiplier on development effort, PM. These rating can range from
Extra Low to Extra High. For the purposes of quantitative analysis, each
rating level of each EM has a weight associated with it. The nominal or
average weight for an EM is 1.0. If a rating level causes more software
development effort, then its corresponding EM weight is above 1.0. Conversely,
if the rating level reduces the effort then the corresponding EM weight
is less than 1.0. The selection of effort-multipliers is based on a strong
rationale that they would independently explain a significant source of
project effort or productivity variation.</FONT>

of the process to be used. This model could be employed in either Application
